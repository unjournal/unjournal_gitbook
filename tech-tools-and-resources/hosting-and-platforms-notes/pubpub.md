# PubPub

We are currently using PubPub ([https://unjournal.pubpub.org/](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/)) as our main platform for hosting evaluations and ratings, manager summaries, and author responses. It offers flexibility, a good user-experience, and a range of features to help us integrate this work into the bibliometrics and archives (e.g., assigning DOIs). (See discussion of options in "[Options for hosting reviews](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DMoliF6aDrX76zKaZMWWCckNBgaG1XLTJ3p51Mz-R6Y/edit#heading=h.2x6lqmpl319)" doc.) We may find ways to use it in our submission platform and editorial management workflow as well; we are exploring this further._Some relevant private Gdocs (ask for access):_
