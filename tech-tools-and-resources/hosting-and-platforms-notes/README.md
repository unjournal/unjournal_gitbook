# Hosting & platforms

{% hint style="info" %}
**January 2026**: This page describes The Unjournal's current technical infrastructure for managing evaluations and publishing outputs.
{% endhint %}

## Evaluation hosting: PubPub

Our primary platform for publishing evaluation packages (evaluations, ratings, author responses, and manager summaries) is [PubPub](https://www.pubpub.org/).

**[unjournal.pubpub.org](https://unjournal.pubpub.org)** — Browse all published evaluations

We work with [Knowledge Futures](https://www.knowledgefutures.org/) to develop PubPub features that support journal-independent evaluation. Each evaluation receives a DOI and is indexed in academic search engines and bibliometrics.

## Editorial management: Coda

We use [Coda](https://coda.io/) for internal workflow management, including:
- Research prioritization and tracking
- Evaluator recruitment and coordination
- Evaluation form submissions
- Payment processing

Most team processes are documented in our internal Coda workspace (accessible to team members).

## Knowledge base: GitBook

This GitBook site serves as our public knowledge base, documenting:
- Our policies, guidelines, and evaluation workflow
- Background on The Unjournal's mission and approach
- Resources for evaluators, authors, and partners
- Historical records of our progress and development

The GitBook is searchable and regularly updated. See [this-gitbook-editing-it-etc.md](this-gitbook-editing-it-etc.md "mention") for information on contributing.

<summary>Archived: Previous platforms (2022-2023)</summary>

During our pilot phase, we explored several platforms:

- **Kotahi**: We initially used Kotahi for editorial management but moved away from it as our processes evolved. See [archived Kotahi documentation](kotahi-sciety-phasing-out/).
- **Sciety**: We maintained a Sciety group for evaluation curation. While we remain interested in Sciety integration, our primary hosting is now on PubPub.
- **Hypothes.is**: Used as a workaround database during early development.
