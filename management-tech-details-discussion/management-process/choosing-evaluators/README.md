# Choosing evaluators

{% hint style="info" %}
See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GdQsfXUjtAsKiYkJ8Z59MZf-ri8\_1ytEU1Tdi8uWaV8/edit#heading=h.ymkhnxb0cfxe) for discussion of Airtable processes for choosing evaluators.
{% endhint %}

## Considerations for _selecting_ evaluators (i.e., 'reviewers')

1. If not 'submitted', did the people who _suggested_ the paper suggest any evaluators?
2. Consider our (signed up) "evaluator pool" (see Airtable/ask for access) first
3. Expertise in the aspects of the work that needs evaluation; consider "one expert per aspect"
4. Interest in the topic/subject (look at citations in both directions); check – are these meaningful citations?
5. [Conflicts of interest?](avoiding-coi.md)
   * Consult "web of connections" tools like ResearchRabbit
6. _Secondary concerns_
   * Likely alignment and engagement with _Unjournal_ priorities,
   * Good writing skills
   * Likely to have time and be motivated to write review in timely fashion
