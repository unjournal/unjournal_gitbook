# Choosing evaluators

{% hint style="info" %}
See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GdQsfXUjtAsKiYkJ8Z59MZf-ri8\_1ytEU1Tdi8uWaV8/edit#heading=h.ymkhnxb0cfxe) for discussion of Airtable processes for this
{% endhint %}

## Considerations for _selecting_ evaluators (i.e., 'reviewers')

1. Consider our (signed up) 'Reviewer pool' (see Airtable) first
2. Expertise in the aspects of the work that needs evaluation; consider 'one expert per aspect'
3. Interest in the topic/subject (look at citations in both directions); Check – Are these 'meaningful citations'?
4. [Conflicts of interest?](avoiding-coi.md)
   * Consult 'web of connections' tools like ResearchRabbit
5. _Secondary concerns_
   * Likely alignment and engagement with Unjournal priorities,
   * Good writing skills
   * Likely to have time/be motivated to write review in timely fashion
