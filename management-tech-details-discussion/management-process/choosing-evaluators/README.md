# Choosing evaluators (considerations)

## Things we consider in choosing evaluators (i.e., 'reviewers')

1. Did the people who _suggested_ the paper suggest any evaluators? &#x20;
2. We prioritize our "evaluator pool" (people who signed up)&#x20;
3. Expertise in the aspects of the work that needs evaluation
4. Interest in the topic/subject
5. Conflicts of interest (especially co-authorships)
6. _Secondary concerns:_ Likely alignment and engagement with _Unjournal_ priorities. Good writing skills. Time and be motivation to write review promptly and thoroughly.
