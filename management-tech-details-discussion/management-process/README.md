### Informing paper authors

If the work was not submitted to the Unjournal directly, then you will need to write to the authors of the paper to let them know that their paper will be evaluated by The Unjournal. (Note that we need/needed to _ask them_ if they are willing unless the work falls under our [direct-evaluation-track.md](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/considering-projects/direct-evaluation-track.md "mention")\
&#x20;

### Finding evaluators

Please use the link below to help you consider how to choose evaluators. Normally 2-3 evaluators are chosen.

[choosing-evaluators](choosing-evaluators/ "mention")



### Reaching out to evaluators

Once you have chosen possible evaluators, reach out to them. You could possibly use or adapt the text templates in the Airtable under the evaluator tab. For example, the "referee outreach (pilot long)" or "short referee outreach (NBER phase)". It is common that you will have to reach out to multiple potential evaluators as they may reject the offer, or not respond.

Normally, we also send a reminder email roughly two weeks after sending the initial email in case the email has been missed. You could use the "Referee informal followup/reminder" or "PS to referee request" text templates from the Airtable for this. To speed up the process and automate your reminders, you can use Boomerang, this is explained in this link here:

[other-tech-and-tools](../../tech-tools-and-resources/other-tech-and-tools/ "mention")

18 Jun 2023: We are working on a Mailchimp process for this. Later, we are likely to integrate this into our editorial management system (at PubPub or elsewhere).



If an evaluator agrees, send them the google doc with the evaluation template for them to complete in an additional email and agree a time period in which they will complete the evaluation.

### Reminding evaluators

After the agreed time period has elapsed and they have not sent the evaluation, it may be necessary to send a reminder email. This can be short and just direct them to the original email.

### When you receive one evaluation

1. Check through the evaluation and ensure that nothing is missing from the evaluation or if you have any questions for the evaluation.
2. If you have no further questions or amendments, you can direct the evaluator to payment information:

[fiscal-hosting-and-expenses.md](../fiscal-hosting-and-expenses.md "mention")

3. Wait to receive all the evaluations before proceeding to the next step.

### When you receive all the evaluations

1. Let the evaluators know that you will be sharing the evaluations with the authors. Inform them that their names will not be shared at this stage but they are free to reach out the authors. You could use the "letting evaluators know about sharing of evaluations with authors" text template in the Airtable.
2. Share the evaluations with the authors, removing any identifying information about the evaluator. You can compile the evaluations into a single document using our google doc template which we can share with you. You can adapt or modify one of the responses in the Airtable under text\_templates. Perhaps "share\_eval\_with\_authors\_simple" or "Compiled evaluations template -- for author sharing and publication".
3. If the authors say "we won't be able to respond" then let them know we will put it up shortly and proceed. Otherwise we give them 2 weeks to respond before putting it up (and they can always respond afterwards).
4. Write up an Evaluation Manager's report if you like (this is optional).
5. We put all of this up on PubPub, get a DOI, integrate with Sciety, publicize this, etc.
6. Once the evaluations are up on PubPub, you could reach out the evaluators again with the link, in case they want to view their evaluation and the others.
