# Research scoping discussion spaces

_15 Aug 2023_: We are organizing some meetings and working groups, and building some private spaces ... where we are discussing 'which specified research themes and papers/projects we should prioritize for UJ evaluation.'&#x20;

This is guided by concerns we discuss in other sections (e.g., '[what research to target](../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/considering-projects/what-research-to-target.md)',  '[what is global priorities relevant research](../the-field-and-ea-gp-research.md)')

Research we prioritize, and short comments and ratings on its prioritization is currently maintained in our Airtable database (under 'crucial\_research'). We consider  'who covers and monitors what' (in our core team) in the 'mapping\_work' table). This exercise suggested some loose teams and projects. I link some (private) Gdocs for those project discussions below.  We aim to make a useful discussion version/interface public when this is feasible.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Team members and field specialists: You should have access to a Google Doc called _"Unjournal Field Specialists+: Proposed division (discussion), meeting notes",_ where we are dividing up the monitoring and prioritization work.

_Some of the content in the sections below will overlap._

## General discussions of prioritization

[Unjournal: Which research? How to prioritize/process it?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ei-3t2bUazjlBOIg8chLxOrz\_sXl\_osAzrLU4hO1wDk/edit#heading=h.lb7kfao9mvkc)

6. Global poverty: Macro, institutions, growth, market structure&#x20;
7. Evidence-based policy organizations, their own assessments and syntheses (e.g., 3ie)
8. How to consider and incorporate adjacent work in epidemiology and medicine



## Economics as a field, sub-areas

1. Environmental economics and policy



## Psychology and 'attitudes/behavioral'

1. [Unjournal/Psychology research: discussion group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eSt9gLHPd-pM4P-OQdWs2VDhVStIqEyFAi77QNbi-Jk/edit#heading=h.xwbv4lj2051e): How can UJ source and evaluate credible work in psychology? What to cover, when, who, with what standards...&#x20;
2. Moral psychology/psychology of altruism and moral circles



## Innovation, scientific progress, technology

1. Innovation, R\&D, broad technological progress
2. Meta-science and scientific productivity
3. Social impact of AI (and other technology)
4. Techno-economic analysis of impactful products (e.g., cellular meat, geo-engineering)&#x20;



## Catastrophic risks (economics, social science, policy)

1. Pandemics and other biological risks
2. Artificial intelligence; AI governance and strategy (is this in the UJ wheelhouse?)
3. International cooperation and conflict

## Applied research/Policy research stream

See [discussion here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/management-tech-details-discussion/policies-issues-discussion#policy-work-not-mainly-intended-for-academic-audiences).\


## Other

1. Long term population, growth, macroeconomics
2. Normative/welfare economics and philosophy (should we cover this?)
3. Empirical methods (should we consider some highly-relevant subset, e.g., meta-analysis?)
