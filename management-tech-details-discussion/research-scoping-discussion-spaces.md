# Research scoping discussion spaces

15 Aug 2023: We are organizing some meetings and working groups, and building some private spaces ... where we are discussing 'which specified research themes and papers/projects we should prioritize for UJ evaluation.'&#x20;

This is guided by concerns we discuss above (e.g., [what research to target](../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/considering-projects/what-research-to-target.md),  [what is global priorities relevant research](../the-field-and-ea-gp-research.md)?)

Research we prioritize, and short comments and ratings on its prioritization is currently maintained in our Airtable database (under 'crucial\_research'). We consider  'who covers and monitots what' (in our core team) in the 'mapping\_work' table). This exercise suggests some loose teams and projects. I link some (private) Gdocs for those project discussions below.  We aim to make a useful version discussions public when it is feasible.



_Some of the content in the sections below will overlap._

## Development economics, global health, adjacent

1. NBER, CEPR, etc: 'Who covers what'?
2. 'Impactful, Neglected, Evaluation-Tractable' work in the global-health and RCT-driven intervention-relevant part of development economics
3. Mental health and happiness; HLI suggestions
4. Givewell specific recommendations and projects&#x20;
5. Governance/political science
6. Global poverty: Macro, institutions, growth, market structure&#x20;
7. How to consider and incorporate adjacent work in epidemiology and medicine



## Economics as a field, sub-areas

1. Syllabi (and \~agendas): Economics and global-priorities (and adjacent work)
2. Microeconomic theory and its applications? When/what to consider?&#x20;
3. Environmental economics and policy
4. The Economics of animal welfare (market-focused)



## Psychology and 'attitudes/behavioral'

1. [Unjournal/Psychology research: discussion group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eSt9gLHPd-pM4P-OQdWs2VDhVStIqEyFAi77QNbi-Jk/edit#heading=h.xwbv4lj2051e): How can UJ source and evaluate credible work in psychology? What to cover, when, who, with what standards...&#x20;
2. Moral psychology/psychology of altruism and moral circles



## Innovation, scientific progress, technology

1. Innovation, R\&D, broad technological progress
2. Meta-science and scientific productivity
3. Social impact of AI (and other technology)
4. Techno-economic analysis of impactful products (e.g., cellular meat, geo-engineering)&#x20;

## Catastrophic risks (economics, social science, policy)

1. Pandemics and other biological risks
2. Artificial intelligence; AI governance (is this in the UJ wheelhouse?)
3. International cooperation and conflict

## Non-academic/policy research stream

See: [#non-academic-policy-research-stream](research-scoping-discussion-spaces.md#non-academic-policy-research-stream "mention")



## Other

1. Long term population, growth, macroeconomics
2. Normative/welfare economics and philosophy (should we cover this?)
3. Empirical methods (should we consider some highly-relevant subset, e.g., meta-analysis?)
