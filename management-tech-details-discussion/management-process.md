# Management Process

### When you receive one evaluation

1. Check through the evaluation and ensure that nothing is missing from the evaluation or if you have any questions for the evaluation.
2. If you have no further questions or ammendments, you can direct the evaluator to payment information:

{% content-ref url="hosting-and-platforms/fiscal-hosting-and-expenses.md" %}
[fiscal-hosting-and-expenses.md](hosting-and-platforms/fiscal-hosting-and-expenses.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

3. Wait to receive all the evaluations before proceeding to the next step.

### When you receive all the evaluations

1. Let the evaluators know that you will be sharing the evaluations with the authors. Inform them that their names will not be shared at this stage but they are free to reach out the evaluators. You could use the "letting evaluators know about sharing of evaluations with authors" text template in the Airtable.
2. Share the evaluations with the authors, removing any identifying information about the evaluator. You can compile the evaluations into a single document using our google doc template which we can share with you. You can adapt or modify one of the responses in the Airtable under text\_templates. Perhaps "share\_eval\_with\_authors\_simple" or "Compiled evaluations template -- for author sharing and publication".
3. If the authors say "we won't be able to respond" then let them know we will put it up shortly and proceed. Otherwise we give them 2 weeks to respond before putting it up (and they can always respond afterwards).
4. Write up an Evaluation Manager's report if you like (this is optional).
5. We put all of this up on PubPub, get a DOI, integrate with Sciety, publicize this, etc.
6. Once the evaluations are up on PubPub, you could reach out the evaluators again with the link, in case they want to view their evaluation and the others.
