## Management team and administrators

The main platforms for the management team are outlined below with links provided.

### Slack group and channels

_Please ask for group access, as well as access to private channels,_ especially "_management-policies_". Each channel should have a description and some links at the top.

Slack is for quick conversations and coordination. Please don't consider Slack as a place to store and organize content. Longer, more structured content should go into Google Docs or similar.

### **GitBook** (edit access optional)

See [tech-scoping.md](../tech-tools-and-resources/tech-scoping.md "mention")

Management team: You don't _need_ to edit the GitBook if you don't want to, but we're trying to use it as our main place to 'explain everything' to ourselves and others. We will try to link all content here. Note you can use 'search' and 'lens' to look for things.

### PubPub

Access to the PubPub is mainly only needed for doing 'full-service evaluation manager work'.

[**Link to our PubPub page**](https://unjournal.pubpub.org)

### Google drive: Gdocs and Gsheets

_Please ask for access to this drive._ This drive contains meeting notes, discussion, grant applications and tech details.
