# UJ Team: resources, onboarding

See also (and integrate): Jordan's ['Onboarding notes'](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pw-PRvri7xdqO8HWpfCPjRDAZZhgjOlxCFZoJ3wE5IU/edit)

## Management team and administrators

The main platforms for the management team are outlined below with links provided.

### Slack group and channels

_Please ask for group access, as well as access to private channels,_ especially "_management-policies_". Each channel should have a description and some links at the top.

[Slack is for quick conversations and coordination.](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

### Airtable

_Please ask for an invitation._ Airtable is an interactive online relational database. Only our management team and selected others [(with careful controls)](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] should have access to the Airtable.

Each of the 'tables' in the Airtable is explained in the first ('readme') table...

<details>

<summary>The Airtable is serving several functions at the moment, including:</summary>

* Project management (see "broad\_goals" and "tasks" tables)

<!---->

* "CRM" & external comms (see "people-orgs", "participants\_etc", "org-link", "text\_templates", ...)

<!---->

* Editorial/evaluation management (discussed below)

<!---->

* Data storage ("output\_eval")

<!---->

* Surveys and internal discussion/consensus ("questions", "responses")

_Going forward, some of these functions may be replaced by other tools_

### GitBook (edit access optional)

See [tech-scoping.md](../tech-tools-and-resources/tech-scoping.md "mention")

Management team: You don't _need_ to edit the GitBook if you don't want to, but we're trying to use it as our main place to 'explain everything' to ourselves and others. We will try to link all content here. Note you can use 'search' and 'lens' to look for things.

### PubPub

Access to the PubPub is mainly only needed for doing 'full-service evaluation manager work'.

[**Link to our PubPub page**](https://unjournal.pubpub.org)

### Google drive: Gdocs and Gsheets

_Please ask for access to this drive._ This drive contains meeting notes, discussion, grant applications and tech details.

1. Get to know it's features, it's super-useful. E.g., 'views' provide different pictures of the same information. 'Link' field types connect different tables by their primary keys, allowing information and calculations to flow back and forth.
2. ... as well as by hovering over the '(i)' symbol for each tab. Many of the columns in each tab also have descriptions.
3. That includes our management team (and key administrators) only.

[^1]: Please don't consider Slack as a place to store and organize content. Longer, more structured content should go into Google Docs or similar (and if important, later be linked or incorporated into this Gitbook and the Airtable).\
    \
    (However, we will be probably be getting a nonprofit discounted Slack pro soon, which would make it somewhat better.)

[^2]: Even considering this limited, we keep more sensitive in this AIrtable encrypted, or moved to a different table that only David Reinstein has access to.

[^3]: Use discretion: advisory board members might be authors, evaluators, job candidates, or parts of external organizations we may partner with
