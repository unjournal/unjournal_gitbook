{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

## Management team and administrators

The main platforms for the management team are outlined below with links provided.

### Slack group and channels

_Please ask for group access, as well as access to private channels,_ especially "_management-policies_". Each channel should have a description and some links at the top.

[Slack is for quick conversations and coordination.](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

### Airtable

_Please ask for an invitation._ Airtable[^2] is an interactive online relational database. Only our management team and selected others [(with careful controls) should have access to the Airtable.](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]

Each of the 'tables' in the Airtable is explained in the first ('readme') table...

<details>

<summary>The Airtable is serving several functions at the moment, including:</summary>

* Project management (see "broad\_goals" and "tasks" tables)

<!---->

* "CRM" & external comms (see "people-orgs", "participants\_etc", "org-link", "text\_templates", ...)

<!---->

* Editorial/evaluation management (discussed below)

<!---->

* Data storage ("output\_eval")

<!---->

* Surveys and internal discussion/consensus ("questions", "responses")

_Going forward, some of these functions may be replaced by other tools_

</details>

_**Read:**_ [**Unjournal Airtable Guide**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GdQsfXUjtAsKiYkJ8Z59MZf-ri8\_1ytEU1Tdi8uWaV8/edit) (Google Doc: internal access only) for a concise understanding of what you need to know and use most. Feel free to ask sidebar questions.

_**Watch:**_ [**Unjournal Airtable Overview**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1k9j2w82qshgp9m/unjournal\_airtable\_overview.mp4?dl=0) (Dropbox: internal access only)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**11 Oct 2023 partial update:**

* Divided the airtable into two airtables, one focusing on research and evaluation, and the other focusing on everything else
* We're moving task management to **ClickUp** (nearly set up, onboarding soon)\_
* Much of the evaluation management process will be moved to PubPub (coming soon, we hope)
* ClickUp may also be used for much of the internal knowledge base content, including much of the present "Management details" Gitbook section.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **GitBo**ok (edit access optional)

See [tech-scoping.md](../tech-tools-and-resources/tech-scoping.md "mention")

Management team: You don't _need_ to edit the GitBook if you don't want to, but we're trying to use it as our main place to 'explain everything' to ourselves and others. We will try to link all content here. Note you can use 'search' and 'lens' to look for things.

### PubPub

Access to the PubPub is mainly only needed for doing 'full-service evaluation manager work'.

[**Link to our PubPub page**](https://unjournal.pubpub.org)

### Google drive: Gdocs and Gsheets

_Please ask for access to this drive._ This drive contains meeting notes, discussion, grant applications and tech details.

### Open Collective Foundation

This is for submitting invoices for your work.

## Advisory board

The main platforms needed for the advisory board are outlined below with links provided.

### Slack group and channels

Members of the advisory board can join our Slack (if they want). They can have access to private channels (subject to discretion[^4]) other than the 'management-policies' channel

### Airtable: with discretion

Advisory board members can be given access to our Airtable, but subject to discretion[^5]. _Before adding an advisory board member to the Airtable,_ please move any content related to their own research, their evaluation work, their job application status, etc.

Short of full Airtable access, AB members they may also be given specific access to 'survey links' and key views.

## Evaluation managers/managing evaluations

In addition to the management team platforms explained above, additional information for how to use the platforms specifically for managing evaluations is outlined below.

### Airtable

To use Airtable for evaluation management please see this [**google doc**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GdQsfXUjtAsKiYkJ8Z59MZf-ri8\_1ytEU1Tdi8uWaV8/edit#heading=h.7l9r6w4dc83p). The section is titled "Managing evaluations of research". To find this in the google drive, it is under "forms\_templates\_tips\_guidelines\_for\_management".

### PubPub

[**Link to our PubPub page**](https://unjournal.pubpub.org)

For details on our current PubPub process please see this [**google doc**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Yr95JbeCrDOrn4GpYWamxj2ZcOp9Ex\_arfz-7jZnko/edit#heading=h.57ljlv1pdkue). To find this in the google drive, it is under "hosting and tech".

### Open Collective Foundation

This should be used for payments for evaluators. Please see the link below for how to do this.

## Notes:

1. Airtable: Get to know it's features, it's super-useful. E.g., 'views' provide different pictures of the same information. 'Link' field types connect different tables by their primary keys, allowing information and calculations to flow back and forth.
2. Airtable table descriptions: as well as by hovering over the '(i)' symbol for each tab. Many of the columns in each tab also have descriptions.
3. Additional Airtable security: We also keep more sensitive in this AIrtable encrypted, or moved to a different table that only David Reinstein has access to.
4. Use discretion in sharing: advisory board members might be authors, evaluators, job candidates, or parts of external organizations we may partner with



[^1]: Please don't consider Slack as a place to store and organize content. Longer, more structured content should go into Google Docs or similar (and if important, later be linked or incorporated into this Gitbook and the Airtable).\
    \
    (However, we will be probably be getting a nonprofit discounted Slack pro soon, which would make it somewhat better.)
