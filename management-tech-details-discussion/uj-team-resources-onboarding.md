### Slack group and channels

Management team: You don't _need_ to edit the GitBook if you don't want to, but we're trying to use it as our main place to 'explain everything' to ourselves and others. We will try to link all content here. Note you can use 'search' and 'lens' to look for things.

### PubPub

Access to the PubPub is mainly only needed for doing 'full-service evaluation manager work'.

### Google drive: Gdocs and Gsheets

_Please ask for access to this drive._ This drive contains meeting notes, discussion, grant applications and tech details.

## Notes:

1. Airtable: Get to know it's features, it's super-useful. E.g., 'views' provide different pictures of the same information. 'Link' field types connect different tables by their primary keys, allowing information and calculations to flow back and forth.
2. Airtable table descriptions: as well as by hovering over the '(i)' symbol for each tab. Many of the columns in each tab also have descriptions.
3. Additional Airtable security: We also keep more sensitive in this AIrtable encrypted, or moved to a different table that only David Reinstein has access to.
4. Use discretion in sharing: advisory board members might be authors, evaluators, job candidates, or parts of external organizations we may partner with



[^1]: Please don't consider Slack as a place to store and organize content. Longer, more structured content should go into Google Docs or similar (and if important, later be linked or incorporated into this Gitbook and the Airtable).\

    (However, we will be probably be getting a nonprofit discounted Slack pro soon, which would make it somewhat better.)
