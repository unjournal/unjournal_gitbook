# Policies/issues discussion

## Considering papers/projects

### Direct-evaluation track: when to proceed with papers that have "R\&R's" at a journal?



### 'Policy work' not (mainly) intended for academic audiences?

E.g., should we consider evaluating papers put out by organizations like Open Philanthropy, the Happier Lives Institute, or Rethink Priorities that aim at impact but might not be written with academic standards in mind?



## Evaluation procedure and guidelines

### Feedback and discussion vs. evaluations

> DR: I suspect that signed reviews (cf blog posts) provide good feedback and evaluation. However, when it comes to rating (quantitative measures of a paper's value), my impression from existing initiatives and conversations is that people are reluctant to award anything less than 5/5 'full  marks'.

### Why Single-blind?

* Power dynamics: referees don't want to be 'punished', may want to flatter powerful authors
* Connections and friendships may inhibit honesty
* 'Powerful referees signing critical reports' could hurt ECRs&#x20;

### Why signed reports?

* Public reputation incentive for referees
  * (But note single-blind paid review has some private incentives.)&#x20;
* Fosters better public dialogue
* Inhibits obviously unfair and impolite 'trashing'

### Compromise approaches

* Author and/or referee choose whether it should be single-blind or signed
* Random trial: We can compare empirically (are signed reviews less informative?)
* Use a mix (1 signed, 2 anonymous reviews) for each paper



### Timing of releasing evaluations

Should we wait until _all_ commissioned evaluations are in, as well as authors' responses, and release these as a group, or should we sometimes release a subset of these if we anticipate a long delay in others? (If we did this, we would still stick by our guarantee to give authors two weeks to respond before release.&#x20;

### Anonymity of evaluators

Revisit our "evaluators decide if they want to be anonymous" policy?



### Non-Anonymity of Managing editors

<summary>Considerations</summary>

My memory is that when submitting a paper, I usually learn who the Senior Editor was but not the managing editor. But there are important differences in our case.  For a traditional journal the editors make an ‘accept/reject/R\&R’ decision. The referee’s role is technically an advisory one. In our case, there is no such decision to be made. For The Unjournal, ME’s are choosing evaluators, corresponding with them, explaining our processes, possibly suggesting what aspects to evaluate, and perhaps putting together a quick summary of the evaluations to be bundled into our output. But we don’t make any ‘accept/reject/R\&R’ decisions … once the paper is in our system and on our track, there should be a fairly standardized approach. Because of this, my thinking is:

1. We don’t really need so many ‘layers of editor’ … a single Managing Editor (or co-ME’s) who consult other people on the UJ team informally … should be enough
2. ME anonymity is probably not necessary; there is less room for COI, bargaining, pleading, reputation issues etc.
