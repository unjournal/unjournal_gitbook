# Hosting & platforms

## Editorial management and paper intake: Kotahi

14 Nov 2022: For now, only managers/editors and authors will interact with [this page](https://unjournaldev.cloud68.co/login). We plan to adapt it to become the interface for evaluations as well.

13 Dec 2022: Moving in this direction

Currently, the majority of our process is not done through Kotahi. We would need funds to make a more bespoke interface.

### Host for Kotahi: Cloud68

Domain name: [unjournal.org](https://unjournal.org) should take people to dashboard page (or login if necessary)

Will change this to: unjournalplatform.org\
\
14 Nov 2022-- the login page is taking people to the wrong place for now

## Output from evaluations goes to...

Gets into a single hypothes.is account: [https://hypothes.is/users/TheUnjournal](https://hypothes.is/users/TheUnjournal)

_This is essentially a workaround database. We are not using the full features of hypothes.is yet._ See [this slack thread](https://unjournalfriends.slack.com/archives/C03FF28KUC8/p1670510898279639)/this Gdoc for the thoughts and progress on this.
