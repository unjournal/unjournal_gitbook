3. Go to OCF _not to_ Open Collective for most things. (Maybe go to OC only for questions on the overriding web page platform. Note that if you use the 'help' on the page it often takes you to OC.)

_Note, for support issues/tickets or tickets there is no record that users can view yet_

## Submitting and paying expenses/claims

{% hint style="info" %}
**Anonymity** **and payments**: **Evaluators, please use a pseudonym or the "salted hash" code we shared with you!**

\
**As our expenses on OCF are all visible to the public, if you request payment for an evaluation (even if you are signing it), please **_**use a pseudonym for your profile name**_ (either the 'salted hash' we've provided, or make one up and tell us this pseudonym in other private correspondence.)

\
_For good measure, do not indicate the name of the paper in the expense claim._

_However, please do note "Evaluation of research material" in the "statement of work" section._
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Why do we suggest anonymity for invoicing evaluations even if the evaluator is making their identity public?</summary>

We may wish to pay different base amounts for hard-to-source expertise or  specific requests. We also intend to give prizes and incentives for strong work. \
\
In general we want to be transparent and to explain and justify our choices, including these payments. However, if people claim payments on the OCF page and see others were paid more (or less), they might initially find this unfair. We don't have a clear way to explain the context _on that page_, thus I thought anonymity would be preferrable.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why do we call it a 'salted hash'</summary>

The 'hash' represents a one-way encryption of either your name or email. We store this information in a database shared only internally at the Unjournal. If you are asking for full anonymity this information is only kept on the hard drive of our co-manager, operations RA, and potentially the evaluator.\
\
_But if we used this_ anyone who knows your name or email could potentially 'check' if you were the person it pertained to. That's why we 'salt' it: we add an additional bit of 'salt', a password only known to our co-managers and operations RA before we encrypt it. This better protects your anonymity.

</details>

After you obtain your hash, or inform us of your pseudonym:

1. Go to [https://opencollective.com/the-unjournal](https://opencollective.com/the-unjournal)
2. Under the brief information about the unjournal there are a few tabs; there is a tab on the right hand-side called “submit expense” that you need to click.
3. Following this, you will need to login/create an account. This is very straightforward; it just requires you to add your "salted" hash/pseudonym as your name and an email address with no password.
4. In your profile settings be sure to add your "legal name". This is only visible to the Unjournal admins and is not public. If not, you may be contacted separately by OCF asking you to do this.
5. Afterwards, you can fill in all your information about how they would like to be paid and which account (details of filling in your payment information can be viewed below).
6. We then approve the expense and they will be paid within 7 days of our approval.

_Request payment from The Unjournal. Expenses will be processed once approved by a Collective admin. **The amount, description, and your profile name are public, but attachments, payment details, and other personal info is kept private.**_

#### Payment information

* Claimants (evaluators etc.) must start an account (basically leave email and payment information) and submit an ['expense document' 'invoice'](https://opencollective.com/the-unjournal/expenses/new). See below for an example of the payment process.\

[^1]: if this proves too cumbersome for them, we can make a simple survey (Google form etc) to ask for this.\\
