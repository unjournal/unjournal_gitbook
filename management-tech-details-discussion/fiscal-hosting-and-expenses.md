## Submitting for payments and expenses

**Evaluators**: To claim your payment for evaluation work, please complete [this brief form](https://coda.io/form/Evaluator-Payment-Form_dcWCCK_L6cH).

You will receive your payment via a [Wise](https://wise.com/home/) transfer (they may ask you for your bank information if you don't have an account with them).

We aim to process all payments within one week.

**Confidentiality**: Your identity will only be visible to The Unjournal administrators for the purposes of making this payment. If you have concerns about the payment process, please contact us at [contact@unjournal.org](mailto:contact@unjournal.org).

**Team members and contractors**: Please refer to the internal Coda workspace for expense submission procedures.
