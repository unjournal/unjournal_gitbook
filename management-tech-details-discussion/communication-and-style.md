# Communication and style

#### Style

To aim for consistency of style in all _UJ_ documentation, a short style guide for the GitBook has been posted [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10aooH\_YCVX\_\_pXFqnY1l8Kn2\_DPX9wdHdR9AfImSuDs/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to suggest changes or additions using the comments. \
Note this document, like so many, is under construction and likely to change without notice. The plan is to make use of it for any outward-facing communications.
