# 'Reviewers': Identify, engage

**Status: 7 Sep 2022**

1. Volunteer pool of 59 reviewers (see Airtable), responding to [call-for-participants-research.md](../master/call-for-participants-research.md "mention")
2. For our (2 focal) pilot papers we have a total of 2 committed referees (1 finished review), one mixed signal, and waiting to hear back from others (we have not outreached much on the second paper). Status tracked in Airtable`Reviewer_process` in `participants_reviewers` (will move to Kotahi)
