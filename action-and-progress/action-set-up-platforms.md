# Set up platforms

> Set up the basic platforms for posting and administering reviews and evaluations and offering curated links and categorizations of papers and projects.

**Update 7 Sep 2022**: We are setting up processes and forms in [Kotahi](https://kotahi.community/)

* We have an instance
* [Submissions form  ](https://unjournaldev.cloud68.co/kotahi/newSubmission)is pretty close to useable (but imperfect, e.g., we need to ask people to (click 'submit a URL instead' on page one)
* Evaluations form is OK, with some workarounds (we ask for a link out to a Google Doc they must duplicate) ... we will probably replace this with an Airtable or Google survey 'submission form' soon
* We are [mapping-workflow-process.md](../key-issues-explanations-faq/mapping-workflow-process.md "mention") for how projects will enter, be evaluated, and 'output'
* We will outline specific [requests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BasFdbN0a8OVLwjB2\_F\_GpECgJpYI2iWRO8fZuU13Z0/edit#heading=h.dkt5cpu55te) for developers

#### Kotahi and Sciety for Unjournal

Kotahi is the platform we will be working on and in, and will give a public-facing page where our evaluations will be hosted.&#x20;

We will get this to feed into [Sciety](https://sciety.org/) with help from the Kotahi/Sciety team, so these show up as ‘evaluated pre-prints’  in their public database. And we will have a [group](https://sciety.org/groups) on Sciety that will curate all of our reviews linked to the preprints.
