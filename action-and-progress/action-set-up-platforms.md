**Update 7 Sep 2022, partial update 22 Dec 2022**

* &#x20;We are setting up processes and forms in [Kotahi](https://kotahi.community/)
  * [Submissions form  ](https://unjournaldev.cloud68.co/kotahi/newSubmission)is pretty useable (but imperfect, e.g., we need to ask people to (click 'submit a URL instead' on page one)
* Evaluations form: using a Gdoc for now, trying out Airtable, Qualtrics and other solutions, aiming to integrate it into Kotahi

<!---->

* See [mapping-workflow-process.md](../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/mapping-workflow-process.md "mention") for how projects will enter, be evaluated, and 'output'
* We will outline specific [requests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BasFdbN0a8OVLwjB2\_F\_GpECgJpYI2iWRO8fZuU13Z0/edit#heading=h.dkt5cpu55te) for developers\

* Sciety group set up with 'Hypothes.is feed'; working on processing first evaluations\

#### Kotahi and Sciety for Unjournal

Kotahi is the platform we will be working on and in, and will give a public-facing page where our evaluations will be hosted.&#x20;

We use a hypothes.is workaround to have this feed into [Sciety](https://sciety.org/) so these show up as ‘evaluated pre-prints’  in their public database, gaining a DOI. We have a [group](https://sciety.org/groups) on Sciety that will curate all of our reviews linked to the preprints.

We are working on improving the ability to use the Hypothes.is collaborative annotation more fully.
