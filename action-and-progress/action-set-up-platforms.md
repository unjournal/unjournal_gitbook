# Set up platforms

> Set up the basic platforms for posting and administering reviews and evaluations and offering curated links and categorizations of papers and projects.

Update 27 Jun 2022: We are leaning towards [Kotahi](https://kotahi.community/).

#### Kotahi and Sciety for Unjournal

Kotahi is the platform we will be working on and in, and will give a public-facing page where our evaluations will be hosted.&#x20;

We will get this to feed into [Sciety](https://sciety.org/) with help from the Kotahi/Sciety team, so these show up as ‘evaluated pre-prints’  in their public database. And we will have a [group](https://sciety.org/groups) on Sciety that will curate all of our reviews linked to the preprints.
