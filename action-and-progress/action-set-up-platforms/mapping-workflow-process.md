# Mapping workflow/process

## Initial sketch

1. &#x20;Author creates new submission (submits a URL and DOI)
   1. (Alt: Project submitted independently of authors; authors asked/informed)
2. Author completes a submission form
3. Managing Editor(s) (ME) selects projects for review (see [considering-projects.md](../../key-issues-explanations-faq/policies-and-templates/considering-projects.md "mention")),&#x20;
   1. ME fills in additional information (in same 'submission form') explaining why it is relevant, what should be evaluated, etc.
4. ME assigns Handling Editor (HE) to selected project
5. HE invites Reviewers (aka 'Evaluators')
6. Reviewer accepts/declines invitation to review
7. Reviewer completes a review form (atm this involves an out-link to a gdoc or survey, allowing better-formatted content and input options)
8. Reviewer submits evaluation including numeric ratings
9. HE collates all reviews for sharing with Author
10. HE shares review with Author
11. Author reads reviews and provides feedback inline. _(DR: what does 'inline' mean here? They should be able to respond in any way they like, I think.)_
12. _Optional_: Author makes 'minor revisions' and submit a new linked manuscript version
13. _Optional_: Reviewers can comment on these minor revisions _and adjust their rating if desired_
14. (Skip this for our pilot stage, discuss whether we want this later: HE initiates second round of review, go to step 5)
15. HE publishes peer review (with all above content) to [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/))&#x20;
16. This feeds into our (to be set up) space on [https://sciety.org/](https://sciety.org/)

<summary>Why only 'minor revisions'?</summary>

We basically don't want to replicate the slow and inefficient processes of the traditional system. We want evaluators to basically give a report and rating _as the paper stands._&#x20;

We also want to encourage papers as [permanent-beta ](../../key-issues-explanations-faq/benefits-and-features/living-research-projects.md)projects. The authors can improve it, if they like, and resubmit it for a new evaluation.&#x20;
