# Identify pilot/key projects/papers, contact authors



{% hint style="info" %}
25 Jun 2022 Update: We have identified (see process below, and open call) a fairly large list, with several very prominent pieces of research to use for the pilot. We aim to invite referees to evaluate 3-4 papers soon, and award the 'bounties' shortly.

## Test-case research for Proof of Concept

_**We need to identify a small set of papers or projects as representative first-cases. This will make things concrete and help us test the system we are building.**_

_Pete Slattery:_ "Do a complete test run using a single paper and team…" Thus I aim to identify a small set of papers (or projects), maybe 2-3, that seem like good test and example cases. Offer a ‘bounty’ for 'which projects do we choose as test cases'.

{% hint style="info" %}
_In doing the above, we will also collect a longer list of key papers, projects, authors, topics, issues, etc., to help us in_ [action-overall-scoping.md](../../the-field-and-ea-gp-research/action-overall-scoping.md "mention") and to use in the future.
{% endhint %}

## Steps proposed and taken

1. **Posts on EA Forum** (and other places)**,** \_\_ [_and form_](https://airtable.com/shrdHHI0zK7rkJCP3) _(see view at bottom of this section); promoting further, with bounty._

[_**Rules for bounty HERE**_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Z4ENov9BYvbvrtFju1X5d8-mD0vCdyagSPd9ArSC2Y/edit)

2\. **Search for most-cited papers** (within our domain) among EA-aligned researchers and organizations

**3. Dig into existing lists, reviews, syllabi such as:**

* GPI [research agenda](https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/research-agenda-web-version/#22\_Epistemological\_issues) (includes many posed questions)
* Open Philanthropy[ "questions that might affect our grantmaking"](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/technical-and-philosophical-questions-might-affect-our-grantmaking) (needs updating? few academic links)
* [The EA Behavioral Science Newsletter](https://preview.mailerlite.com/m9i6r0j7h9)
* Syllabi:
  * [Pablo's list](http://www.stafforini.com/blog/effective-altruism-syllabi/)
    * [Economics focus](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/economics-for-ea-and-vice-versa/existing-resources-programs-examples) list
  * David Rhys-Bernard's syllabus ([link to my commented/highlighted version)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LeHrhhAcSWGQze6nSeaA9eNIXoG2vqPKM6-PrHognR0/edit)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that much of the work identified above will already have been peer-reviewed and 'published'. While we envision that the Unjournal may assess papers _already published in traditional journals_, this is probably not the best case for the PoC.

**5. Appeal directly to authors and research groups**
