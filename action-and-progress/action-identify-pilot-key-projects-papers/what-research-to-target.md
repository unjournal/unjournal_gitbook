_Excerpt:_

1. _**W**_**hy is it relevant and worth engaging with?**

Consider: Global priority importance, field relevance, open science, authors' engagement, data and reasoning transparency\
\
2\. **Why does it need (more) review, and what are some key issues and claims to vet?**

* What are (some of) the authorsâ€™ main important claims that are worth carefully evaluating?&#x20;
* What aspects of the evidence, argumentation, methods, interpretation, etc., are you unsure about?&#x20;
* What particular data, code, proofs, etc., would you like to see vetted. If it has already been peer-reviewed in some way, why do you think more review is needed?
