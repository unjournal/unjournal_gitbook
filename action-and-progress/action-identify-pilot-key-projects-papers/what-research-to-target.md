_Excerpt:_&#x20;

_**W**_**hy is it relevant and worth engaging with?**

Consider: Global priority importance, field relevance, open science, authors' engagement, data and reasoning transparency\
\
**Why does it need (more) review, and what are some key issues and claims to vet?** \
_****_What are (some of) the authors’ main important claims that are worth careful evaluating? What aspects of the evidence, argumentation, methods, interpretation, etc., are you unsure about? What particular data, code, proof, etc., would you like to see vetted. If it has already been peer reviewed in some way, why do you think more review is needed?
