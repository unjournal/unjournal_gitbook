# Sciety

Sciety is essentially a hub for _curating_ the sort of evaluations that Unjournal aims to do.  Users can access research works that have been publicly evaluated&#x20;

\
There are several initiatives of public, and sometimes journal-independent peer evaluation, including [several groups listed on Sciety](https://sciety.org/groups), such as the [Biophysics Collab](https://sciety.org/groups/biophysics-colab/lists), [Rapid Reviews COVID-19](https://sciety.org/groups/rapid-reviews-covid-19/lists), and [E-Life](https://sciety.org/groups/elife/lists). However, these are _nearly exclusively in biology and related areas.._



[Sciety's mission:](https://sciety.org/about)

> Scietyâ€™s mission is to grow a network of researchers who evaluate, curate and consume scientific content in the open. In doing so, we will support several long-term changes to scientific communication:
>
> * Change peer review to better recognize its scholarly contribution
> * Shift the publishing decision from editors to authors
> * Move evaluation and curation activity from before to after publication
>
> Our community-driven technology effort is producing an application that can support the changes in behaviour required to secure this future.\
