# Economics survey (Charness et al)

## **Improving peer review in economics: Charness et al project and survey**





> We designed and disseminated a **survey taken by over 1,400 economists** in order to (i) understand their experiences with peer review and (ii) collect opinions about potential proposals to improve the system. &#x20;
>
> ...
>
> We reviewed the **existing literature about peer review,** drawing on sources from inside and outside of economics. ... We then built a (non-comprehensive) **themed bibliography**,
>
>
>
> ...  we took the additional step of preparing a **list of over 160 proposals,**\

> **Other peer review models**\
> Our current peer review system relies on the feedback of a limited number of ad-hoc referees, given after a full manuscript was produced. We consider several changes that could be made to this model, including:&#x20;
>
> * **Post-publication peer review**: Submissions could be published immediately and then subjected to peer review, or they could be subject to continued evaluation at the conclusion of the standard peer-review process.&#x20;
> * **Peer review of registered reports**: Empirical papers could be conditionally accepted before the results are known, based on their research question and design. A limited number of journals have started to offer publication tracks for registered reports.
> * **Crowdsourced peer review and prediction markets**: Rather than relying on a small number of referees, the wisdom of crowds could be leveraged to provide assessments of a manuscript's merits.&#x20;
> * **Non-economists and non-academics as referees**: Besides enlarging the size of the pool of referees who assess a paper, the diversity of the pool could be increased by seeking the opinion of researchers from other disciplines or non-academics, such as policy makers.&#x20;
> * **Collaborative peer review platforms**: Communication between authors, reviewers, and editors could be made more interactive, with the implementation of new channels for real-time discussion. Collaborative platforms could also be set up to solicit feedback before journal submission occurs.
