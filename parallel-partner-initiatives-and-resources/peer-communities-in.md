# Peer Communities In

PCI and the Peer Community Journal (a diamond open access journal) has considerable overlap with The Unjournal model. They started out (?) as a 'recommendation system' but now have the PCI journal which exists to "publish unconditionally free of charge exclusively ... on an opt-in basis any article recommended by a PCI". [Each PCI has its own policies](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

* &#x20;the standard ‘recommender’ model has an approved recommender volunteer to play the role of managing editor for a paper and make the decisions; authors are consulted to recommend reviewers.&#x20;
  * COI? E.g., I become ‘recommender’ for a friend/for the stuff that supports my agenda
* 17 Peer Communities In -- mainly in life sciences (some seem to have just started, no public preprints up)
* Authors must _submit_ work (?)
* They (opt-in) ‘publish’ the article rather than being an ‘overlay journal’, to improve their indexing possibilities (but this is opt-in, and you can also submit elsewhere & there are 'PCI-friendly' journals)
* They depend on volunteer evaluations
* 0/1 and descriptive rather than quantitative evaluation

    Are there overall constraints on these?
