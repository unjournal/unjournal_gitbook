# eLife



[eLife's](https://elifesciences.org/) is/was a fairly well respected (?) journal in Life Sciences. Their New Model (originally called 'publish, review, curate') was big news. Their three month update seems fairly stable/successful. Here's their FAQ.. Their model is similar to our model in many ways but it's mainly/only for life sciences.  They use [Sciety](https://sciety.org/) for curation

* They don't have explicit quantitative metrics, but an "eLife assessment... is written with the help of a common vocabulary to ensure consistency"... which may proxy this.
* Evaluators (reviewers) are not compensated ("We offer remuneration to our editors but not to our peer reviewers").
* Reviewers' names are not displayed ("All public comments posted alongside a preprint will be signed by eLife and not by individuals, putting the onus on eLife as an organisation and community to ensure that the outputs of our peer-review process are of the highest standard.)
* They charge a $2000 APC. (Presumably, for all 'reviewed preprints' on the Elife website, whether or not you request it become a 'version of record')
* The evaluation is non-exclusive unless you request the "Reviewed Preprint" be "a Version of Record which will be sent to indexers like PubMed and can be listed in funding, job applications and more."
* Some share of the work they cover are registered reports
