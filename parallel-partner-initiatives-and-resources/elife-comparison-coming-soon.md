# eLife



[eLife's](https://elifesciences.org/) is a fairly well respected (?) journal in Life Sciences. Their New Model (originally called "publish, review, curate") was big news. Their three-month update seems fairly stable and successful. Here's their FAQ. Their model is similar to ours in many ways, but it's mainly or exclusively for life sciences. They use [Sciety](https://sciety.org/) for curation.

* They don't have explicit quantitative metrics, but an "eLife assessment . . . is written with the help of a common vocabulary to ensure consistency," which may proxy this.
* Evaluators (reviewers) are not compensated. ("We offer remuneration to our editors but not to our peer reviewers.")
* Reviewers' names are not displayed. ("All public comments posted alongside a preprint will be signed by eLife and not by individuals, putting the onus on eLife as an organisation and community to ensure that the outputs of our peer-review process are of the highest standard.")
* They charge a $2,000 APC. Presumably, this is true for all "reviewed preprints" on the eLife website, whether or not you request it become a "version of record."
* The evaluation is non-exclusive unless you request that the reviewed preprint be a "'Version of Record' that will be sent to indexers like PubMed and can be listed in funding, job applications and more."
* Some share of the work they cover are registered reports.
