# Parallel/partner initiatives and resources

## Related initiatives

As part of _The Unjournal's_ general approach, we keep track of and maintain contact with other initiatives in open science, open access, robustness/transparency, and encouraging impactful research. We want to be coordinated. We want to partner with other initiatives and tools where there is overlap, and clearly explain where (and why) we differentiate from other efforts.

See our **[Related Initiatives Comparison](related-initiatives-comparison.md)** for a curated overview of initiatives in the same space, including:
- [COS LifeCycle Journal](https://lifecyclejournal.org/) - open review where Unjournal is an evaluation provider
- [Institute for Replication (I4R)](https://i4replication.org/) - robustness replication of top papers
- [Peer Communities In (PCI)](https://peercommunityin.org/) - diamond open access with recommender model
