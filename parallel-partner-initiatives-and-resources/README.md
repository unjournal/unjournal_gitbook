# Parallel/partner initiatives and resources

## Related initiatives

As part of _The Unjournal’_&#x73; general approach, we keep track of and maintain contact with other initiatives in open science, open access, robustness/transparency, and encouraging impactful research. We want to be coordinated. We want to partner with other initiatives and tools where there is overlap, and clearly explain where (and why) we differentiate from other efforts.&#x20;

The [ Airtable view](https://airtable.com/shrCs2pDDA9cwZuC8) below gives a preliminary breakdown of some initiatives that are the most similar to—or partially overlap—ours, and tries to catalog the similarities and differences to give a picture of who is doing what and in what fields.
