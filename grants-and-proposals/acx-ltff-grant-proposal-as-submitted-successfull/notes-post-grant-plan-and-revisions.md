### Administrative concerns (and possible amendments)

Rethink Priorities will act as fiscal sponsor for this, to help administer payments. They will also receive $5,000 to cover roughly two hours/week of Reinstein's time on this project.

**Administering payments to referees, researchers, etc.**

We will need to make small payments to (say) 20–50 different referees, 5–10 committee members and "editorial managers," 5–10 research prize winners, as well as clerical and IT assistants.

### Spreading the word: our "press release" (WIP)
