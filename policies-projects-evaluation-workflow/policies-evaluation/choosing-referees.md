# Choosing 'referees'

## Considerations for _selecting_ evaluators

1. Consider our (signed up) 'Reviewer pool' (see Airtable) first
2. Expertise in the aspects of the work that needs evaluation; consider 'one expert per aspect'
3. Interest in the topic/subject (look at citations in both directions); Check – Are these 'meaningful citations'?
4. Conflicts of interest?&#x20;
   1. Consult 'web of connections' tools like ResearchRabbit&#x20;
5. _Secondary concerns_&#x20;
   1. Likely alignment and engagement with Unjournal priorities,&#x20;
   2. Good writing skills
   3. Likely to have time/be motivated to write review in timely fashion
