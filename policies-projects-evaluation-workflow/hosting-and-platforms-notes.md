14 Nov 2022: For now, only managers/editors and authors will interact with this page. We plan to adapt it to become the interface for evaluations as well.&#x20;

Currently, the majority of our process is not done through Kotahi.&#x20;

### Host for Kotahi: Cloud68

Domain name: [unjournal.org](https://unjournal.org) should take people to dashboard page (or login if they are not logged in)&#x20;

Will change this to: unjournalplatform.org\
\
14 Nov 2022-- the login page is taking people to the wrong place for now



## Output from evaluations goes to...&#x20;

&#x20;Gets into a single hypothes.is account: [https://hypothes.is/users/TheUnjournal\
](https://hypothes.is/users/TheUnjournal)

_This is essentially a workaround database_



## Main public curated space: Sciety.org

_We've applied for a group: (can we get unjournal.org to redirect here?)_

_Expected to be ready in early December 2022._
