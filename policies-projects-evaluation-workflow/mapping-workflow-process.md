# Mapping workflow/process

## (Revised 8 Feb '23) Initial sketch&#x20;

1. &#x20;Author creates new submission (submits a URL and DOI)
   * Alt: Project submitted independently of authors; authors asked/informed
   * Alt: see [direct-evaluation-track.md](considering-projects/direct-evaluation-track.md "mention")
2. Author (or someone on their behalf) completes a submission form&#x20;
   * This includes a potential 'request for embargo' or other special treatment
3. Managing Editor(s) (ME) selects projects for review (see [considering-projects](considering-projects/ "mention")),&#x20;
   * ME fills in additional information (in same 'submission form') explaining why it's relevant, what to evaluate, etc.
   * Decides whether to grant embargo/special treatment, notes this
4. ME assigns Handling Editor (HE) to selected project
5. HE invites Evaluators (aka 'Reviewers')
   * Potential evaluators given full access to (almost) all information submitted by author and ME, notified of any embargo/special treatment granted
   * ME may make special requests to evaluator (e.g., 'signed/unsigned evaluation only', short deadlines, extra incentives, etc.)
6. Evaluator accepts/declines invitation to review, agrees on deadline (or asks for extension)
7. Evaluator completes a review form (atm this includes an out-link to a gdoc or survey, allowing better-formatted content and input options); aim to embed in [kotahi-submit-eval-mgmt.md](../management-tech-details-discussion/hosting-and-platforms/kotahi-submit-eval-mgmt.md "mention")
8. Reviewer submits evaluation including numeric ratings and predictions, confidence intervals
   * _Possible addition (future plan)_: Reviewer asks for 'minor revisions and corrections; see 'considering: allowing minor revisions' in fold below
9. HE collates all reviews for sharing with Author,  shares reviews and ratings with Author
   * Share names of evaluators if they are 'signed', otherwise [be very careful about anonymity](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].&#x20;
   * Share evaluations with the authors as separate doc/file/space; which [the evaluators _do not have automatic access to_](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]_._
   * Make it clear to authors: their responses will be published (and given a DOI when we can).
10. Author(s) reads evaluations, given two weeks to submit responses
    * _If there is an embargo, there is more time to do this, of course_
11. &#x20;HE publishes peer review (with all of the above content) to Hypothes.is&#x20;
    * ... If no embargo, otherwise wait until after embargo ends/authors release it
12. This feeds into our [Sciety curated space](https://sciety.org/groups/the-unjournal/about)&#x20;

    * ...as well as into some other platforms like Kotahi, and [we are working](../management-tech-details-discussion/other-tech-and-tools/) on DOIs for each element)



## Considering for future: enabling  'minor revisions'

In our current (8 Feb 2023: Pilot) phase, we have the evaluators consider the paper 'as is', frozen at a certain date, with no room for revisions. The authors can of course revise the paper on their own, and even pursue an updated Unjournal review; and we would like to include links to the 'permanently updated version' in the Unjournal evaluation space.

_After the pilot, we may consider making minor revisions part of the evaluation process._ This may add substantial value to the papers and process, especially where evaluators identify straightforward and easily-implementable _improvements._&#x20;



<details>

<summary>How revisions might be folded into the above flow</summary>

_If 'minor revisions' are requested_:&#x20;

* ...  the author has 4 weeks (strict) to make these if they want to, submit a new linked manuscript, and also submit their response to the evaluation.
* _Optional_: Reviewers can comment on any minor revisions _and adjust their rating_

</details>

### **Why would we (potential consider) only 'minor' revisions?**

We don't want to replicate the slow and inefficient processes of the traditional system. We want evaluators to basically give a report and rating _as the paper stands._&#x20;

We also want to encourage papers as [permanent-beta ](../benefits-and-features/living-research-projects.md)projects. The authors can improve it, if they like, and resubmit it for a new evaluation.&#x20;

[^1]: No evaluator content should be linked to real names anyway, but doublecheck.

[^2]: Make this clear to authors. Authors can reach out to evaluators and share any of this if they wish, but they are not required to do so.&#x20;
