# Mapping workflow/process

## Initial sketch

1. &#x20;Author creates new submission (submits a URL and DOI)
   * (Alt: Project submitted independently of authors; authors asked/informed)
2. Author completes a submission form
   * This includes a potential 'request for embargo' or other special treatment
3. Managing Editor(s) (ME) selects projects for review (see [considering-projects](considering-projects/ "mention")),&#x20;
   * ME fills in additional information (in same 'submission form') explaining why it's relevant, what to evaluate, etc.
   * Decides whether to grant embargo/special treatment, notes this
4. ME assigns Handling Editor (HE) to selected project
5. HE invites Reviewers (aka 'Evaluators')
   * Potential reviewers given full access to (almost) all information submitted by author and ME, notified of any embargo/special treatment granted
   * ME may make special requests to reviewer (e.g., 'signed/unsigned review only', short deadlines, extra incentives, etc.)
6. Reviewer accepts/declines invitation to review, agrees on deadline (or asks for extension)
7. Reviewer completes a review form (atm this includes an out-link to a gdoc or survey, allowing better-formatted content and input options)
8. Reviewer submits evaluation including numeric ratings
9. _Optional_: Reviewer asks for 'minor revisions and corrections
10. HE collates all reviews for sharing with Author
11. HE shares review with Author
12. _If no revisions are requested:_ Author reads reviews,  given two weeks to submit response through the "threaded\_discussion"&#x20;
    * _If there is an embargo, there is more time to do this, of course_
13. _If 'minor revisions' are requested_:&#x20;
    * ...  the author has 4 weeks (strict) to make these if they want to, submit a new linked manuscript, and also submit their response to the evaluation.
    * _Optional_: Reviewers can comment on any minor revisions _and adjust their rating_
14. &#x20;HE publishes peer review (with all of the above content) to Hypothes.is&#x20;
    * ... If no embargo, otherwise wait until after embargo ends/authors release it
15. This feeds into our (to be set up) space on [https://sciety.org/](https://sciety.org/)

<summary>Why only 'minor revisions'?</summary>

We basically don't want to replicate the slow and inefficient processes of the traditional system. We want evaluators to basically give a report and rating _as the paper stands._&#x20;

We also want to encourage papers as [permanent-beta ](../key-issues-explanations-faq/benefits-and-features/living-research-projects.md)projects. The authors can improve it, if they like, and resubmit it for a new evaluation.&#x20;
