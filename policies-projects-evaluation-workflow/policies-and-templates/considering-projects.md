# Considering papers (projects)

## Submission/evaluation funnel

26 Oct 2022:  As we are paying evaluators and have limited funding, we cannot evaluate every paper/project.&#x20;

So far, **papers have come into our database** through&#x20;

1. Submission by authors
2. Our own searches (e.g., searching syllabi, forums, working paper archives and white papers)
3. Suggestions from other researchers, practitioners, and members of the public (e.g., following [the 'bounty' we posted here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see) and advertised in other places) &#x20;

Our management team **rates the suitability of each paper** according to criteria discussed below and [in the aforementioned linked post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see). \
\
For the papers/projects at the top of our list, **we contact the authors** **and ask if they are willing to engage.** We have only pursued papers where the authors give approval.  ****  We are not required to ask authors for permission, but we hope this generates goodwill and higher-value engagement.&#x20;

However, we may change this policy going forward, particularly, to directly commission evaluations of the most relevant high-profile work in high-prestige working paper series such as [NBER](https://www.nber.org/), or work that has already published in peer-reviewed journals, but might merit further attention.

## Communicating: **‘Editors’ process**&#x20;

_In deciding which papers/projects to send out to paid reviewers/evaluators, we have considered the following issues._&#x20;

_We will try to communicate this information about each paper/project to reviewers before they write their evaluations. We may hold back some discussion to avoid biasing the reviewers or because of discretion issues._

### Summary, why is it relevant and worth engaging with?

**Consider**: Global priority importance ([what-is-ea-gp-relevant-research.md](../../the-field-and-ea-gp-research/what-is-ea-gp-relevant-research.md "mention")), field relevance, open science, authors’ engagement, data and reasoning transparency. You may consider the [ITN framework](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework-1), but not too rigidly. See our [guidelines-for-evaluators](../policies-evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/ "mention") for more discussion.

### **Why does it need (more) review, and what are some key issues and claims to vet?**

What are (some of) the authors’ main important claims that are worth carefully evaluating? What aspects of the evidence, argumentation, methods, interpretation, etc., are you unsure about? What particular data, code, proof, etc., would you like to see vetted. If it has already been peer-reviewed in some way, why do you think more review is needed?

### **Author engagement**

How well has the author engaged with the process? Do they need particular convincing? Do they need help making their engagement with The Unjournal successful?

## Possible adjustment: Direct evaluation of prominent work

_We are considering the following pivot_

> 1.  Choose a set of 'top tier working paper series’ as well as medium-to-top tier journals&#x20;
>
>     * Starting with the [NBER working paper series](https://www.nber.org/papers?page=1\&perPage=50\&sortBy=public\_date)
>     * May expand this to, e.g., work published in the Annual Review of Psychology
>
>
> 2.  Identify relevant papers in this series, according to criteria outlined and linked above ([relevance](considering-projects.md#summary-why-is-it-relevant-and-worth-engaging-with), strength, [need for further review](considering-projects.md#why-does-it-need-more-review-and-what-are-some-key-issues-and-claims-to-vet)).&#x20;
>
>     __\
>     _For NBER this is likely to include..._
>
>     * recently released work in the early stages of the journal peer-review process, particularly if it addresses a timely subject as well as&#x20;
>     * work that has been around for many years, been widely cited and influential, yet never published in a peer-reviewed journal.
>
>     _We will try to do this in as systematically and transparently as feasible, so authors do not feel 'singled out'_ \
>
> 3.  Notify the work's authors that The Unjournal plans to commission evaluations. Not 'asking for permission' but...&#x20;
>
>     * Making them aware of The Unjournal, the process, the[ benefits to authors](../../key-issues-explanations-faq/faq-interaction/for-researchers-authors.md#why-should-researchers-and-groups-submit-their-work-to-and-engage-with-the-unjournal), and their opportunities to engage with the evaluation, and publicly respond to the evaluation before it is made public
>     * Letting the authors complete our forms, if they wish to, giving some further information about the paper/project and, e.g., a 'permalink' to updates
>     * Asking if there are authors in sensitive career positions justifying a [temporary 'embargo](../../key-issues-explanations-faq/faq-interaction/for-researchers-authors.md#conditional-embargo)',
>     * Asking the authors if there is specific feedback they would like to receive
>
>
> 4. Reaching out to and commissioning evaluators, as in our regular process. _Considerations_:
>    * These evaluators will be notified that the authors have not directly requested this review but they are informed it is happening. We suspect this will tend to drive evaluators to prefer to remaining anonymous.
>    * As this will allow us to consider a larger set of papers more quickly, we can reach out to multiple evaluators more efficiently.   &#x20;

_The case for the pivot proposed above:_

1. Working papers (especially NBER) are already influencing policy and debate; yet they have not been peer-reviewed, and may take years to go through this process, if ever (e.g., many NBER papers[ are never published in peer-reviewed journals](https://bldavies.com/blog/publication-outcomes-nber-working-papers/)). However it is difficult to understand their limitation unless you happen to have attended an academic seminar where these have been presented. Evaluating these publicly will provide a service
   * Specifically for NBER: This working paper series is highly influential and relied on by policy makers and policy journalists. It is an elite outlet: only members of NBER are able to post working papers here. [Membership is prestigious and available only by invitation.](https://economistwritingeveryday.com/2022/05/02/lets-talk-about-the-nber/)&#x20;
2. &#x20;There may be some shyness or reluctance to participate in The Unjournal evaluation process (see our [benefits to authors](../../key-issues-explanations-faq/faq-interaction/for-researchers-authors.md#why-should-researchers-and-groups-submit-their-work-to-and-engage-with-the-unjournal) discussion).  It is scary to be a first mover, and it may feel unfair to be among the few people to have an evaluation of your work out there in public (in spite of the Bayesian arguments presented in the previous link).&#x20;
3. Academics (especially early-career) may also worry that they will seem weird or rebellious by submitting to The Unjournal and that this may be taken as 'rejecting mainstream system norms'. This will be less of a problem if a large number substantial number of prominent papers have already been evaluated publicly by The Unjournal. You will be 'in good company'. Furthermore, if we are simply identifying papers for evaluation, the authors of these papers cannot be seen as 'rebelling' as they did not choose this,&#x20;
