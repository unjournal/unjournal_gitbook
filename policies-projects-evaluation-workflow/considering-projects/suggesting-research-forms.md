# Suggesting research (forms)

Research can be "submitted" by authors ([here](https://airtable.com/applDG6ifmUmeEJ7j/shrcN2cwsXpmnkOL1)) or "suggested" by others. For a walk-through on suggesting research, see [this video](https://us06web.zoom.us/rec/share/Px36RA3cbYvb8Evi-wj6-cFHRLAiexe0FPVi\_8xvZavqestDSDxkWlldK3nPdIk\_.xMbOsXG\_2BM3A2\_t) example.

There are two main paths for making suggestions: [through our survey form](suggesting-research-forms.md#1.-through-our-survey-form) or [through Airtable](suggesting-research-forms.md#2.-option-for-field-specialists-and-managers-via-airtable).&#x20;

## 1. Through our [survey form](https://airtable.com/applDG6ifmUmeEJ7j/shrAsvmrx05PDHfdw)

Anyone can suggest research using the survey form at [https://bit.ly/ujsuggestr](https://bit.ly/ujsuggestr). (Note, if you want to "submit your own research," go to [bit.ly/ujsubmitr](https://bit.ly/ujsubmitr).) Please include the following steps:

#### Review The Unjournal's Guidelines

Begin by reviewing [_The Unjournal_'s guidelines on _What research to target_](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/considering-projects/what-research-to-target) to get a sense of the research we cover and our priorities. Look for high-quality research that 1) falls within our focus areas and 2) would benefit from (further) evaluation. &#x20;

When in doubt, we encourage you to suggest the research anyway.

#### Fill out the Suggestion Form

Navigate to _The Unjournal_'s [Suggest Research Survey Form](https://airtable.com/applDG6ifmUmeEJ7j/shrAsvmrx05PDHfdw). Most of the fields here are optional. The fields ask the following information:

* Who you are: Let us know who is making the suggestion (you can also choose to stay anonymous).
  * If you leave your contact information, you will be eligible for financial "bounties" for strong suggestions.
  * If you are already a member of _The Unjournal_'s team, additional fields will appear for you to link your suggestion to your profile in the _Unjournal's_ database.
* Research Label: Provide a short, descriptive label for the research you are suggesting. This helps _The Unjournal_ quickly identify the topic at a glance.
* Research Importance: Explain why the research is important, its potential impact, and any specific areas that require thorough evaluation.
* Research Link: Include a direct URL to the research paper. _The Unjournal_ prefers research that is publicly hosted, such as in a working paper archive or on a personal website.
* Peer Review Status: Inform about the peer review status of the research, whether it's unpublished, published without clear peer review, or published in a peer-reviewed journal.
* "Rate the relevance": This represents your best-guess at how relevant this work is for The Unjournal to evaluate, as a percentile relative to other work we are considering.&#x20;
* Research Classification: Choose categories that best describe the research. This helps _The Unjournal_ sort and prioritize suggestions.
* Field of Interest: Select the outcome or field of interest that the research addresses, such as _global health in low-income countries_.

Complete all the required fields and submit your suggestion. _The Unjournal_ team will review your submission and consider it for future evaluation. You can reach out to us at [contact@unjournal.org](mailto:contact@unjournal.org) with any questions or concerns.



## 2. Option for Field Specialists and managers: via Airtable

People on our team may find it more useful to suggest research to _The Unjournal_ directl via the Airtable.  See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yn8uyAs4Wpil45E-RUuov\_\_OerTtOP2lFFD-enePz1Q/edit#heading=h.bm2q1sms6y1a) for a guide to this.
