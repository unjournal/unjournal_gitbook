# What specific areas do we cover (WIP)

As outlined elsewhere...

1. &#x20;We are targeting [global priorities-relevant research](../../the-field-and-ea-gp-research.md).
2. With the potential for impact, and with the potential for _Unjournal_ evaluations to have an impact (see our [high level considerations](what-research-to-target.md#high-level-considerations-for-prioritizing-research) and our  [prioritization ratings](process-prioritizing-research-wip/prioritization-ratings-discussion.md) discussions).
3. Our [initial focus](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] is quantitative work that informs [global priorities (see linked discussion)](../../the-field-and-ea-gp-research.md), especially in [economics, policy, and social science](#user-content-fn-2)[^2], informing our [Theory of Change](../../benefits-and-features/global-priorities-theory-of-change/).
4. We give a data presentation of the work we have already covered and work we are prioritizing [here](https://unjournal.github.io/unjournaldata/chapters/evaluation\_data\_analysis.html), which will be continually updated.

_**But what does this mean in practice? What specific research (fields, topics, approaches, etc.) are we likely to classify as relevant to evaluate?**_

We give some lists and annotated examples below. (Work in progress.)

[^1]: We discuss our prioritization considerations under [global-priorities.md](../../faq-interaction/global-priorities.md "mention")

[^2]: We target these areas (1) because of our current management team's expertise and (2) because these seem particularly in need of The Unjournal's approach. However, we are open to expanding and branching out.
