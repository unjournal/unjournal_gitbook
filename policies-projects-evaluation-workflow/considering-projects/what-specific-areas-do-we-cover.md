# What specific areas do we cover?

1. We are targeting [global priorities-relevant research](../../the-field-and-ea-gp-research.md)...
2. With the potential for impact, and with the potential for _Unjournal_ _evaluations_ to have an impact (see our [high-level considerations](what-research-to-target.md#high-level-considerations-for-prioritizing-research) and our [prioritization ratings](process-prioritizing-research/prioritization-ratings-discussion.md) discussions).
3. Our [initial focus](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] is quantitative work that informs [global priorities (see linked discussion)](../../the-field-and-ea-gp-research.md), especially in [economics, policy, and social science](#user-content-fn-2)[^2], informing our [Theory of Change](../../benefits-and-features/global-priorities-theory-of-change/).
4. We give a data presentation of the work we have already covered and the work we are prioritizing [here](https://unjournal.github.io/unjournaldata/chapters/evaluation_data_analysis.html), which will be continually updated.

_**But what does this mean in practice? What specific research fields, topics, and approaches are we likely to classify as 'relevant to evaluate'?**_

We give some lists and annotated examples below.

## Fields, methods, and approaches

_The Unjournal_ focuses on ...&#x20;

1. Research where the fundamental question being investigated involves _human_ behavior and beliefs and the consequences of these. This may involve markets, production processes, economic constraints, social interactions, technology, the 'market of ideas', individual psychology, government processes, and more. However, the main research question should _not_ revolve around issues outside of human behavio&#x72;_,_ such as physical science, biology, or computer science and engineering. These areas are out of our scope (at least for now). &#x20;
2. Research that is fundamentally _quantitative_ and uses [_scientific_ methods](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]. It will generally involve or consider measurable inputs, choices, and outcomes; specific categorical or quantitative questions; analytical and mathematical reasoning; hypothesis testing and/or belief updating, etc.&#x20;
3. Research that targets and addresses a single _specific_ question or goals, or a small cluster. It should not mainly be a broad discussion and overview of other research or conceptual issues.

This to generally involves the academic fields:

* Economics
* Applied Statistics (and some other applied math)
* Psychology&#x20;
* Political Science
* Other quantitative social science fields (perhaps Sociology)
* Applied "business school" fields:  finance, accounting, operations, etc.
* Applied "policy and impact evaluation" fields&#x20;
* Life science/medicine where it targets human behavior/social science&#x20;

_&#x54;_&#x68;ese discipline/field boundaries are not strict; they may adapt as we grow

### Why this field/method focus?

These were chosen in light of two main factors:

1. Our founder and our team is most comfortable assessing and managing the consideration of research in these areas.
2. These fields seem to be particularly amenable to, and able to benefit from our journal-independent evaluation approach. Other fields, such as biology, are already being 'served' by strong initiatives like [Peer Communities In](https://peercommunityin.org/).

## Outcomes, focus areas, and causes

_The Unjournal's_ mission is to prioritize&#x20;

* research with the strongest potential for a positive impact on global welfare&#x20;
* where public _evaluation_ of this research will have the greatest impact&#x20;

Given this broad goal, we consider research into any cause, topic, or outcome, as long as the research involves fields, methods, and approaches within our domain (see above), and as long as the work meets our other requirements (e.g., research must be publicly shared without a paywall).&#x20;

While we don't have rigid boundaries, we are nonetheless focusing on certain areas:

### Fields

We have mainly commissioned evaluations of work involving development economics and health-related outcomes and interventions in low- and middle-income countries.

As well as research involving

* Environmental economics, conservation, harm to human health&#x20;
* The social impact of AI and emerging technologies&#x20;
* Economics, welfare, and governance
* Catastrophic risks; predicting and responding to these risks
* The economics of innovation; scientific progress and meta-science&#x20;
* The economics of health, happiness, and wellbeing



We are currently prioritizing further work involving&#x20;

* Psychology, behavioral science, and attitudes: the spread of misinformation; other-regarding preferences and behavior; moral circles
* Animal welfare: markets, attitudes
* Methodological work informing high-impact research (e.g., methods for impact evaluation)



We are also _considering_ prioritizing work involving

* AI governance and safety&#x20;
* Quantitative political science (voting, lobbying, attitudes)&#x20;
* Political risks (including authoritarian governments and war and conflict)&#x20;
* Institutional decisionmaking and policymaking
* Long-term growth and trends; the long-term future of civilization; forecasting





### Examples of work we chose to prioritize or de-prioritize based on focus area

&#x54;_&#x6F; do: We will give and explain some examples here_
{% endhint %}

[^1]: We discuss our prioritization considerations under [global-priorities.md](../../faq-interaction/global-priorities.md "mention")

[^2]: We target these areas (1) because of our current management team's expertise and (2) because these seem particularly in need of The Unjournal's approach. However, we are open to expanding and branching out.



[^3]: Broadly, in the sense that Fang and Casadevall (2024) describe... "Science as it is presently understood possesses several essential characteristics: (i) an assumption that nature can be understood without having to invoke supernatural forces; (ii) a requirement for supporting evidence; (iii) arguments that conform to logical chains of reasoning; (iv) accumulation of knowledge that can change and undergo refinement over time as a result of new ideas or observations and improvements in methodology; and (v) predictive power"
