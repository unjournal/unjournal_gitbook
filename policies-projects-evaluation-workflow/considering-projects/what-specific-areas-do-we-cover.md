# What specific areas do we cover?

_As outlined elsewhere..._

1. We are targeting [global priorities-relevant research](../../the-field-and-ea-gp-research.md)...
2. With the potential for impact, and with the potential for _Unjournal_ _evaluations_ to have an impact (see our [high-level considerations](what-research-to-target.md#high-level-considerations-for-prioritizing-research) and our [prioritization ratings](process-prioritizing-research/prioritization-ratings-discussion.md) discussions).
3. Our [initial focus](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] is quantitative work that informs [global priorities (see linked discussion)](../../the-field-and-ea-gp-research.md), especially in [economics, policy, and social science](#user-content-fn-2)[^2], informing our [Theory of Change](../../benefits-and-features/global-priorities-theory-of-change/).
4. We give a data presentation of the work we have already covered and the work we are prioritizing [here](https://unjournal.github.io/unjournaldata/chapters/evaluation\_data\_analysis.html), which will be continually updated.

_**But what does this mean in practice? What specific research (fields, topics, approaches, etc.) are we likely to classify as 'relevant to evaluate'?**_

We give some lists and annotated examples below. (These are works in progress.)

## Fields, methods, and approaches

(Jan. 2024) _The Unjournal_ focuses on ...&#x20;

1. Research where the fundamental question being investigated involves _human_ behavior and beliefs and the consequences of these. This may involve markets, production processes, economic constraints, social interactions, technology, the 'market of ideas', individual psychology, government processes, and more. However, the main research question should _not_ revolve around issues outside of human behavior_,_ such as physical science, biology, or computer science and engineering. These areas are out of our scope (at least for now). &#x20;
2. Research that is fundamentally _quantitative_ and uses [_scientific_ methods](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]. It will generally involve or consider measurable inputs, choices, and outcomes; specific categorical or quantitative questions; analytical and mathematical reasoning; hypothesis testing and/or belief updating, etc.&#x20;
3. Research that targets and addresses a single (or a small number of connected) _specific_ question or goals,  rather than mainly engaging in a broad discussion and overview of other research or conceptual issues.

We expect this to generally involve the academic fields:

* Economics
* Applied Statistics (and some other applied math)
* Psychology&#x20;
* Political Science
* Other quantitative social science fields (perhaps Sociology)
* Applied "business school" fields;  perhaps finance, accounting, operations management
* Applied "policy and impact evaluation" fields&#x20;
* Medicine/health and biology-linked fields, where these target human behavior and social science questions

_Note_: these discipline/field boundaries are not strict and may also change as we grow and adapt.&#x20;

### Why this field/method focus?

These were chosen in light of two main factors:

1. Our founder and our team is most comfortable assessing and managing the consideration of research in these areas.
2. These fields seem to be particularly amenable to, and able to benefit from our journal-independent evaluation approach. Other fields, such as biology, are already being 'served' by strong initiatives like [Peer Communities In](https://peercommunityin.org/).

## Outcomes, focus areas, and causes

_The Unjournal's_ mission is to prioritize&#x20;

* research with the strongest potential to have a positive impact on global welfare and
* where the public _evaluation_ of this research will have the greatest positive impact.&#x20;

Given this broad goal, we will consider research into any cause, topic, or outcome, as long as the research involves fields, methods, and approaches within our domain (see above), and as long as the work meets our other requirements (e.g., research must be publicly shared without a paywall).&#x20;

While we don't have rigid boundaries, we are nonetheless focusing on certain areas that seem likely to have potential for impact (and in areas our team is familiar with). This prioritization is reflected in our team's current research field groupings, as embedded below.  (To do: We will better describe the coverage within these groups.)

(As of Jan. 2024) we have mainly commissioned evaluations of work involving&#x20;

* Development economics
* Global Health and Development; health-related outcomes and interventions in low-income countries&#x20;

As well as some research involving

* Environmental economics, economics of conservation, environmental harm to human health&#x20;
* The social impact of AI and emerging technologies&#x20;
* Economics, welfare, and governance
* Markets for products with externalities
* Catastrophic risks; responses to these risks



We are currently prioritizing further work involving&#x20;

* The economics of innovation; scientific progress and meta-science&#x20;
* Psychology, behavioral science, and attitudes: the spread of misinformation; other-regarding preferences and behavior; moral circles
* Animal welfare: markets, attitudes
* The economics of health, happiness, and wellbeing



We are also _considering_ prioritizing work involving

* AI governance and safety&#x20;
* Quantitative political science (voting, lobbying, attitudes)&#x20;
* Political risks (including malevolent authoritarian governments and war and conflict)&#x20;
* Institutional decisionmaking and policymaking
* Long-term growth and trends; the long-term future of civilization; forecasting
* Methodological work informing high-impact research (e.g., methods for impact evaluation)

[^1]: We discuss our prioritization considerations under [global-priorities.md](../../faq-interaction/global-priorities.md "mention")

[^2]: We target these areas (1) because of our current management team's expertise and (2) because these seem particularly in need of The Unjournal's approach. However, we are open to expanding and branching out.



[^3]: Broadly, in the sense that Fang and Casadevall (2024) describe... "Science as it is presently understood possesses several essential characteristics: (i) an assumption that nature can be understood without having to invoke supernatural forces; (ii) a requirement for supporting evidence; (iii) arguments that conform to logical chains of reasoning; (iv) accumulation of knowledge that can change and undergo refinement over time as a result of new ideas or observations and improvements in methodology; and (v) predictive power"
