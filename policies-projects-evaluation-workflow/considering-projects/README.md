# Considering papers (projects)

## Submission/evaluation funnel

26 Oct 2022:  As we are paying evaluators and have limited funding, we cannot evaluate every paper/project.&#x20;

So far, **papers have come into our database** through&#x20;

1. Submission by authors
2. Our own searches (e.g., searching syllabi, forums, working paper archives and white papers)
3. Suggestions from other researchers, practitioners, and members of the public (e.g., following [the 'bounty' we posted here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see) and advertised in other places) &#x20;

Our management team **rates the suitability of each paper** according to criteria discussed below and [in the aforementioned linked post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see). \
\
For the papers/projects at the top of our list, **we contact the authors** **and ask if they are willing to engage.** We have only pursued papers where the authors give approval.  ****  We are not required to ask authors for permission, but we hope this generates goodwill and higher-value engagement.&#x20;

However, we may change this policy going forward, particularly, to directly commission evaluations of the most relevant high-profile work in high-prestige working paper series such as [NBER](https://www.nber.org/), or work that has already published in peer-reviewed journals, but might merit further attention.

We propose a possible pivot and discuss it below: [considering-direct-evaluation.md](considering-direct-evaluation.md "mention")&#x20;

## Communicating: **‘Editors’ process**&#x20;

_In deciding which papers/projects to send out to paid reviewers/evaluators, we have considered the following issues._&#x20;

_We will try to communicate this information about each paper/project to reviewers before they write their evaluations. We may hold back some discussion to avoid biasing the reviewers or because of discretion issues._

### Summary, why is it relevant and worth engaging with?

**Consider**: Global priority importance ([what-is-ea-gp-relevant-research.md](../../the-field-and-ea-gp-research/what-is-ea-gp-relevant-research.md "mention")), field relevance, open science, authors’ engagement, data and reasoning transparency. You may consider the [ITN framework](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework-1), but not too rigidly. See our [guidelines-for-evaluators](../policies-evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/ "mention") for more discussion.

### **Why does it need (more) review, and what are some key issues and claims to vet?**

What are (some of) the authors’ main important claims that are worth carefully evaluating? What aspects of the evidence, argumentation, methods, interpretation, etc., are you unsure about? What particular data, code, proof, etc., would you like to see vetted. If it has already been peer-reviewed in some way, why do you think more review is needed?

### **Author engagement**

How well has the author engaged with the process? Do they need particular convincing? Do they need help making their engagement with The Unjournal successful?
