# Project selection and evaluation

## Submission/evaluation funnel

As we are paying evaluators and have limited funding, we cannot evaluate every paper/project. Through October 2022, **papers have come into our database** (and will continue to do so) through

1. Submission by authors
2. Our own searches (e.g., searching syllabi, forums, working paper archives, and white papers)
3. [Suggestions from other researchers, practitioners, and members of the public](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

Our management team **rates the suitability of each paper** according to the criteria discussed below and [in the aforementioned linked post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see).

###

### Our procedures for identification and prioritization

We have followed a few procedures for finding and prioritizing papers and projects. Generally, we allow all members of our management team to 'vote' on how much to prioritize a paper before selecting it. In all cases, we require more than one member of our management team (or field specialist) to support a paper before prioritizing it.

&#x20;We are working to build a justified and systematic procedure, as well as to give managers and field specialists some autonomy in prioritizing key papers and projects. As noted elsewhere, we are considering targets for particular research areas and sources.

## Authors' permission: sometimes required

Through October 2022: For the papers/projects at the top of our list, we have contacted the authors and asked if they wanted to engage, and only pursued it further if they agreed.

_As of November 2022_ ... we have a [**second track** where, under certain conditions](#user-content-fn-2)[^2], we inform authors but do not request permission. We first focused on particularly relevant [NBER](https://www.nber.org/papers?page=1\&perPage=50\&sortBy=public\_date) working papers.

_July 2023: Expanded this to some other sources, with some discretion._&#x20;

_See_ [_Direct Evaluation track_](direct-evaluation-track.md)_._

## Communicating: **‘Editors’ process**

_In deciding which papers/projects to send out to paid reviewers/evaluators, we have considered the following issues._ [_We aim to communicate this information_](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] _about each paper/project to evaluators before they write their evaluations._

### Summary, why is it relevant and worth engaging with?

**Consider**: [Global priority importance](../../faq-interaction/global-priorities.md), field relevance, open science, authors’ engagement, data and reasoning transparency. You may consider the [ITN framework](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework-1), but not too rigidly.

### **Why does it need (more) review? What are some key issues/claims to vet?**

What are (some of) the authors’ main important claims that are worth carefully evaluating? What aspects of the evidence, argumentation, methods, interpretation, etc., are you unsure about? What particular data, code, proof, etc., would you like to see vetted? If it has already been peer-reviewed in some way, why do you think more review is needed?

### **Author engagement**

How well has the author engaged with the process? Do they need particular convincing? Do they need help making their engagement with The Unjournal successful?

[^2]: "We will choose the most relevant papers in this prestigious series (in certain categories, and with certain restrictions). We will inform these papers' authors when we have decided to commission these for evaluation. We will give the authors the opportunity to respond and engage, including (as usual) the opportunity to ask for a temporary embargo for sensitive career issues, and the opportunity to respond to the evaluation before it is published. We discuss this further below, explaining the reasoning behind it."

[^3]: However, we may hold back some of this discussion to avoid biasing the reviewers or because of discretion issues.
