# What research to target?

Our [initial focus](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]:[ ](broken-reference/)quantitative work that informs [global priorities](../../the-field-and-ea-gp-research.md), especially in [economics, policy, and social science.](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]&#x20;

_We incorporate some of this discussion below..._

## "When you consider research"...  &#x20;

1. _**W**_**hy is it relevant and worth engaging with?**

Consider: Global priority importance, field relevance, open science, authors' engagement, data and reasoning transparency\
\
2\. **Why does it need (more) review, and what are some key issues and claims to vet?**

* What are (some of) the authors’ main important claims that are worth carefully evaluating?
* What aspects of the evidence, argumentation, methods, interpretation, etc., are you unsure about?
* What particular data, code, proofs, etc., would you like to see vetted? If it has already been peer-reviewed in some way, why do you think more review is needed?



## Ultimate goals: what are we trying to optimize?&#x20;

1. See our  [Global Priorities Theory of Change flowchart](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/benefits-and-features/global-priorities-theory-of-change), targeting ‘ultimate outcomes’:  “Better research & more informative evaluation” → “Better decision-making” → “Better outcomes” (for humanity + animals; ‘survival & flourishing’)
2. _Consideration/discussion_: Do we have other ultimate goals not in that chart? (E.g., to improve research & knowledge-building for its own sake?)

###

## Prioritizing research to achieve these goals &#x20;

In addition to our _ultimate goals_ (\~'direct impact) [There are several intermediate goals/targets along this path, listed below](#user-content-fn-3)[^3], that we may want to consider in prioritizing research to evaluate.

### A. Direct impact (‘score goals now’)

1. **Importance**: Direct impact of research
   1. This is a massive question many have tried to address (see sketches and links)&#x20;
   2. Consult a range of sources, not only EA-linked.
      * EA and adjacent-ish:  [Agendas](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/the-field-and-ea-gp-research/what-is-ea-gp-relevant-research) and overviews, [Syllabi](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/economics-for-ea-and-vice-versa/existing-resources-programs-examples)
        * Non-EA, e.g., [https://globalchallenges.org/](https://globalchallenges.org/)
        * Scope what other sorts of work are representative inputs to GP-relevant work.&#x20;
        * Get a selection of seminal GP publications, look back to see what they are citing and categorize by journal/field/keywords/etc.&#x20;
2. **Neglectedness**: Where is the current journal system failing GP-relevant work the most ... in ways _The Unjournal can address_
3. **Tractability**
   1. “Evaluability” of research; where does our approach yield the most VOI/insight?
   2. ‘Feedback loops’ – where the research influences concrete intervention choices with near-term outcomes – may be very valuable
   3. Where do we have field expertise on the UJ team? → this will help us commission strong evaluations

_Consideration/discussion_: how much should we include research with _indirect_ impact potential (theoretical, methodological, etc.)?



### B. Sustainability: funding, support, participation

Relevance to stakeholders and potential supporters. Inform a balance of ‘cause areas’ of greatest interest (& justify this)

Clear connections to impact; measurability

Support from relevant academic communities

Support from open science

_What will drive further interest and funding?_&#x20;

### &#x20;C. Credibility, visibility, driving positive institutional change

* Interest and involve academics and build status
* Commission evaluations that will be visibly useful and credible
* ‘Benchmark traditional publication outcomes’ and track our predictiveness and impact
* Have strong leverage over research ‘outcomes and rewards’?
* Have visibility and public interest
* Bring in supporters and participants
* Achieve substantial output in a reasonable time frame and with reasonable expense
* Maintain goodwill and the perception (and reality)  that we are being fair and impartial

<details>

<summary>But some of these concerns may trade off ... for example</summary>

We’ve discussed a second ‘non-academic high-impact policy work’ track. This may have direct impact and please SFF funders, but may distract us from changing academic systems, and may cost us status in academia (if not done carefully).&#x20;

A focus on topics perceived as niche (e.g., the economics and game theory of AI governance and AI safety) may bring a similar tradeoff.

On the other hand, perhaps behavioral/experimental economics has lots of academic interest and participants, we can benchmark our evaluations, etc., but it may be less directly impactful.

Giving managers autonomy and ‘pushing forward quickly’ may bring the risk of perceived favoritism; a rule-based systematic approach to ‘what papers to evaluate’ might be slower and less interesting for managers, but might be seen as fairer (and might enable better measurement of our impact)

</details>

## Data:  what are we evaluating/considering?

We're working on presenting and analyzing this [here](https://unjournal.github.io/unjournaldata/chapters/evaluation\_data.html). _28 Jul 2023 -- this is extremely messy and premature; we will post it more publicly when it's in a good shape._

[^1]: We discuss our prioritization considerations under [global-priorities.md](../../faq-interaction/global-priorities.md "mention")

[^2]: We target these areas (1) because of our current management team's expertise and (2) because these seem particularly in need of The Unjournal's approach. However, we are open to expanding and branching out.



[^3]: &#x20;We may need to balance these ‘inputs’ to sustain good outcomes in the medium term. This impacts our choice of ‘what to evaluate’. It’s a difficult multi-dimensional question.
