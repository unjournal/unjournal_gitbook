{% endhint %}



## What we would like you to do

1. **Write an evaluation of the target** [_**paper or project**_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]**,** similar to a standard, high-quality referee report.
2. [**Give quantitative metrics and predictions** as described below.](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]
3. Answer a short questionnaire about your background and our processes.

## Writing the evaluation (aka 'the review')

In writing your evaluation and providing ratings, please consider the following:

### _The Unjournal_'s criteria

Broadly, the review should be similar to a report an academic would write for a traditional high-prestige journal (e.g., see some 'conventional guidelines' [here](conventional-guidelines-for-referee-reports.md)). Specifically, we'd like you to focus on our priorities:

1. Advancing our knowledge and practice
2. Justification, reasonableness, validity, and robustness of methods
3. Logic and communication
4. Open, communicative, replicable science

See our [guidelines below](./#overall-assessment) for more details on each of these. We are not asking you to _structure_ your review according to these metrics, just to pay extra attention to them.

<details>

<summary>Specific requests for focus or feedback</summary>

Please pay attention to anything our managers and editors specifically asked you to focus on. We may ask you to focus on specific areas of expertise. We may also forward specific feedback requests from authors.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The evaluation will be made public</summary>

Unless you were advised otherwise, this evaluation, including the review and quantitative metrics, will be given a DOI and, hopefully, will enter the public research conversation. Authors will be given two weeks to respond to reviews before the evaluations, ratings, and responses are made public. You can choose whether you want to be identified publicly as an author of the evaluation.

</details>

If you have questions about the authors’ work, you can ask them anonymously: we will facilitate this.&#x20;

We want you to evaluate the _most recent/relevant version of the paper/project that you can access_. If you see a more recent version than the one we shared with you, please let us know.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Publishing and signing reviews: considerations and exceptions</summary>

We may give early-career researchers the right to veto the publication of very negative reviews or to embargo the release of these reviews for a defined period. We will inform you in advance if this will be the case for your evaluation.

You can reserve some "sensitive" content in your report to be shared with only _The Unjournal_ management or only the authors, but we hope to keep this limited.

</details>

### **Target audiences**

We designed this process to balance three considerations with three target audiences. Please consider each of these:&#x20;

1. Crafting evaluations and ratings that help researchers and policymakers judge when and how to rely on this research. For _Research Users._
2. Ensuring these evaluations of the _papers_ are comparable to current journal tier metrics, to enable them to be used to determine career advancement and research funding. For _Departments, Research_ _Managers, and Funders._&#x20;
3. Providing constructive feedback to _Authors_.

We discuss this, and how it relates to our impact and "theory of change", [here](../../../faq-interaction/referees-evaluators.md#the-value-of-these-evaluations-what-to-prioritize).

<details>

<summary>"But isn't The Unjournal mainly just about feedback to authors"?</summary>

We accept that in the near-term an _Unjournal_ evaluation may not be seen to have substantial career value.&#x20;

Furthermore, work we are considering _may_ tend be at an earlier stage. authors may submit work to us, thinking of this as a "pre-journal" step.  The papers we _select_ (e.g., from NBER) may also have been posted long before authors planned to submit them to journals.

This may make the 'feedback for authors' and 'assessment for research users' aspects more important, relative to traditional journals' role. \
\
However, in the medium-term, a positive _Unjournal_ evaluation should gain  credibility and career value. This should make our evaluations an "endpoint" for a research paper.

</details>



## Quantitative metrics

We ask for a set of nine quantitative metrics. For each metric, we ask for a score and a 90% credible interval. We describe these in detail below.

### Percentile rankings

For some questions, we ask for a **percentile ranking** from 0-100%. This represents "what proportion of papers in the reference group are worse than this paper, by this criterion". A score of 100% means this is essentially the best paper in the reference group. 0% is the worst paper. A score of 50% means this is the median paper; i.e., half of all papers in the reference group do this better, and half do this worse, and so on.

Here, the population of papers should be _**all serious research in the same area that you have encountered in the last three years.**_

<details>

<summary>"Serious" research? Academic research? </summary>

Here, we are mainly considering research done by professional researchers with high levels of training, experience, and familiarity with recent practice, who have time and resources to devote months or years to each such research project or paper. These will typically be written as 'working papers' and presented at academic seminars, before being submitted to standard academic journals. Although no credential is required, this typically includes people with PhD degrees (or upper-level PhD students). Most of this sort of research is done by full-time academics (professors, post-docs, academic staff, etc.) with a substantial research remit, as well as research staff at think tanks and research institutions (but there may be important exceptions). &#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>What counts as the "same area"?</summary>

This is a judgment call. Here are some criteria to consider: first, does the work come from the same academic field and research subfield, and does it address questions that might be addressed using similar methods? Secondly, does it deal with the same substantive research question, or a closely related one? If the research you are evaluating is in a very niche topic, the comparison reference group should be expanded to consider work in other areas.

</details>

<details>

<summary>"Research that you have encountered"</summary>

We are aiming for comparability across evaluators. If you  suspect that you are particularly exposed to higher-quality work in this category, compared to other likely evaluators, you may want to adjust your reference group downwards. (And of course vice-versa, if you suspect you are particularly exposed to lower-quality work.)

</details>

#### Midpoint rating and credible intervals&#x20;

For each metric, we ask you to provide a 90% credible interval as a measure of your uncertainty. Our interface provides slider bars to express your chosen intervals:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
[_See below_](./#the-credible-intervals-expressing-uncertainty) _for more guidance on credible intervals._
{% endhint %}

The table below summarizes the percentile rankings.

<table><thead><tr><th width="374">Quantitative metric</th><th width="142" align="center">Scale</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Overall assessment</td><td align="center">0 - 100%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Advancing our knowledge and practice</td><td align="center">0 - 100%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Methods: Justification, reasonableness, validity, robustness</td><td align="center">0 - 100%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Logic and communication</td><td align="center">0 - 100%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Open, collaborative, replicable science</td><td align="center">0 - 100%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Real world relevance</td><td align="center">0 - 100%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Relevance to global priorities</td><td align="center">0 - 100%</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Overall assessment

_Percentile ranking (0-100%)_

Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production, and importance to practice.&#x20;

###

### Advancing our knowledge and practice

_Percentile ranking (0-100%)_

To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to practice, particularly in ways that are relevant[^3] to global priorities and impactful interventions?

<details>

<summary>Less weight to "originality and cleverness’"</summary>

Originality and cleverness should be weighted less than the typical journal, because _The Unjournal_ focuses on _impact_. Papers that apply existing techniques and frameworks more rigorously than previous work or apply them to new areas in ways that provide practical insights for GP (global priorities) and interventions should be highly valued. More weight should be placed on 'contribution to GP' than on 'contribution to the academic field'.

</details>

Do the paper's insights inform our beliefs about important parameters and about the effectiveness of interventions?&#x20;

[**We don't require surprising results; sound and well-presented null results can also be valuable.**](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]

Does the project add useful value to other impactful research?

###

### Methods: Justification, reasonableness, validity, robustness

_Percentile ranking (0-100%)_

Are the methods[^5] used well-justified and explained; are they a reasonable approach to answering the question(s) in this context? Are the underlying assumptions reasonable?&#x20;

Are the results and methods likely to be robust to reasonable changes in the underlying assumptions? [Does the author demonstrate this?](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]

Avoiding bias and [questionable research practices](https://forrt.org/glossary/questionable-research-practices-or-/) (QRP): Did the authors take steps to reduce bias from opportunistic reporting [and QRP](#user-content-fn-7)[^7]? For example, did they do a strong pre-registration and pre-analysis plan, incorporate multiple hypothesis testing corrections, and report flexible specifications?&#x20;



### Logic and communication

_Percentile ranking (0-100%)_

Are the goals and questions of the paper clearly expressed? Are concepts clearly defined and referenced?

Is the [reasoning "transparent](#user-content-fn-8)[^8]"? Are assumptions made explicit? Are all logical steps clear and correct? Does the writing make the argument easy to follow?

Are stated conclusions consistent with the evidence (or theoretical proofs) presented?&#x20;

Are the data and/or analysis presented relevant to the arguments made? Are the tables, graphs, and diagrams easy to understand in the context of the narrative (e.g., no major errors in labeling)?

###

### Open, collaborative, replicable science

_Percentile ranking (0-100%)_&#x20;

This covers several considerations:

#### _**Replicability, reproducibility, data integrity**_

Would another researcher be able to perform the same analysis and get the same results? Are the methods explained clearly and in enough detail to enable easy and credible replication? For example, are all analyses and statistical tests explained, and is code provided?

Is the source of the data clear?

Is the necessary data made as widely available as reasonably possible (if applicable)? Ideally, cleaned data should be clearly labeled and explained.

<details>

<summary><em>Optional</em>: Could other researchers reconstruct the output from the shared code and data? </summary>

_Note_ that evaluators are not required to run or evaluate the code; this is at your discretion. However, having a quick look at some of the elements could be helpful. Ideally, the author should give code that allows easy, full replication; for example, a single R script that runs and creates everything, starting from the original data source, and including data cleaning files (even better if '[containerized/dockerized](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/posts/2021-11-16-docker)' to be platform-independent). This would make it fairly easy for an evaluator to check. For example, see[ this taxonomy of "levels of computational reproducibility](https://bitss.github.io/ACRE/assessment.html#score)."

</details>

_**Consistency**_

Do the numbers in the paper and/or code output make sense? Are they internally consistent throughout the paper?

_**Useful building blocks**_

Do the authors provide tools, resources, data, and outputs that might enable or enhance future work and meta-analysis?

###

### Real-world relevance

_Percentile ranking (0-100%)_

Are the assumptions and setup realistic and relevant to the real world? [Does the paper consider the real-world relevance of the arguments and results presented, perhaps engaging policy and implementation questions?](#user-content-fn-9)[^9] &#x20;

Do the authors communicate their work in ways policymakers and decision-makers can understand, without misleading or oversimplifying?

Do the authors present practical _impact quantifications_, such as cost-effectiveness analyses? Do they report results that _enable_ such analyses?

###

### Relevance to global priorities

_Percentile ranking (0-100%)_

Could the paper's topic and approach [_potentially_](#user-content-fn-10)[^10] help inform [global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact interventions?](../../../the-field-and-ea-gp-research.md)&#x20;



## Journal ranking tiers

To help universities and policymakers make sense of our evaluations, we want to benchmark them against how research is currently judged. So, we would like you to assess the paper in terms of journal rankings. We ask for two assessments:&#x20;

1. a normative judgment about 'how well the research _should_ publish';&#x20;
2. a prediction about where the research _will_ be published.

Journal ranking tiers are on a 0-5 scale, as follows:

* 0/5: Marginally respectable, little to no value; not publishable in any journal with scrutiny or credible WP series; not likely to be cited by credible researchers
* 1/5: OK/Somewhat valuable journal
* 2/5: Marginal B-journal/Decent field journal
* 3/5: Top B-journal/Strong field journal
* 4/5: Marginal A-Journal/Top field journal
* 5/5: A-journal/Top journal

We give some example journal rankings [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nnS0FMOIKz-3rFJMn-JsX-6\_oE54gdvCjxs0vac6WF8/edit#gid=0), based on SJR and ABS ratings.

_We encourage you to_ [_consider a non-integer score_](#user-content-fn-11)[^11], e.g. 4.6 or 2.2.&#x20;

As before, we ask for a 90% credible interval.&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="364">Journal ranking tiers</th><th width="248" align="center">Scale</th><th width="238">90% CI</th><th data-hidden><select></select></th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>What journal ranking tier <em>should</em> this work be published in?</td><td align="center">0.0-5.0</td><td><em>lower, upper</em></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>What journal ranking tier <em>will this</em> work be published in?</td><td align="center">0.0-5.0</td><td><em>lower, upper</em></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>



{% hint style="info" %}
**PubPub note:** as of 14 March 2024, the PubPub form is _not_ allowing you to give non-integer responses. Until this is fixed, [please multiply these by 10 and enter these using the 0-50 slider.](#user-content-fn-12)[^12]&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### **What journal ranking tier **_**should**_** this work be published in?**

_Journal ranking tier (0.0-5.0)_

Assess this paper on the journal ranking scale described above, considering only its merit, particularly considering the category metrics we discussed above.

Equivalently, [where would this paper be published](#user-content-fn-13)[^13] if:

1. the journal process was fair, unbiased, and free of noise, and that status, social connections, and lobbying to get the paper published didn’t matter;
2. journals assessed research according to the category metrics we discussed above.

#### What journal ranking tier _will_ this work be published in?

_Journal ranking tier (0.0-5.0)_

<details>

<summary>What if this work has <em>already</em> been peer reviewed and published?</summary>

If this work has already been published, and you know where, please report the prediction you would have given absent that knowledge.

</details>



## The credible intervals: expressing uncertainty

#### **What are we looking for and why?**

We want policymakers, researchers, funders, and managers to be able to _use The Unjournal'_s evaluations to update their beliefs and make better decisions. To do this well, they need to weigh multiple evaluations against each other and other sources of information. Evaluators may feel confident about their rating for one category, but less confident in another area. How much weight should readers   give to each? In this context, it is useful to _quantify the uncertainty_.&#x20;

But it's hard to quantify statements like "very certain" or "somewhat uncertain" – different people may use the same phrases to mean different things. That's why we're  asking for you a more precise measure, your _credible intervals._ These metrics are particular useful for meta-science and meta-analysis.&#x20;

You are also asked to give a 90% credible interval. Consider this as [_**the smallest interval**_](#user-content-fn-14)[^14] _**that you believe is 90% likely to contain the true value.**_ See the fold below for further guidance.

<details>

<summary>How do I come up with these intervals? (Further discussion)</summary>

You may understand the concepts of uncertainty and credible intervals, but you might be unfamiliar with applying them in a situation like this one.

You may have a certain best guess for the "Methods..." criterion. Still, even an expert can never be certain. E.g., you may misunderstand some aspect of the paper, there may be a method you are not familiar with, etc.

Your uncertainty over this could be described by some distribution, representing your beliefs about the _true value_ of this criterion. Your "'best guess" should be the central mass point of this distribution.

You are also asked to give a 90% credible interval. Consider this as [_**the smallest interval**_](#user-content-fn-15)[^15] _**that you believe is 90% likely to contain the true value.**_

For some questions, the "true value" refers to something objective, e.g. will this work be published in a top-ranked journal? In other cases, like the percentile rankings, the true value means "if you had complete evidence, knowledge, and wisdom, what value would you choose?"&#x20;

For more information on credible intervals, [this Wikipedia entry](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Credible\_interval) may be helpful.

If you are "[well calibrated](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Calibrated\_probability\_assessment)", your 90% credible intervals should contain the true value 90% of the time. To understand this better, assess your ability, then practice to get better at estimating your confidence in results. [This web app](https://www.clearerthinking.org/tools/calibrate-your-judgment) will help you get practice at calibrating your judgments.

</details>



## Survey questions

Lastly, we ask evaluators about their background, and for feedback about the process.

<details>

<summary>Survey questions for evaluators: details</summary>

For the two questions below, we will [publish your responses](#user-content-fn-16)[^16] unless you specifically ask these questions  to be kept anonymous.&#x20;

1. How long have you been in this field?
2. How many proposals and papers have you evaluated? _(For journals, grants, and other peer review.)_

Answers to the questions [below will not be made public:](#user-content-fn-17)[^17] &#x20;

1. How would you rate this template and process?
2. Do you have any suggestions or questions about this process or _The Unjournal_? (We will try to respond to your suggestions, and incorporate them in our practice.) \[Open response]
3. Would you be willing to consider evaluating a revised version of this project?

</details>



## Other guidelines and notes

<details>

<summary>Note on the evaluation platform (13 Feb 2024)</summary>

12 Feb 2024: We are moving to a hosted form/interface in PubPub. That form is still somewhat a work-in-progress, and may need some further guidance; we try to provide this below, but please contact us with any questions. [If you prefer](#user-content-fn-18)[^18], you can also submit your response in a Google Doc**,** and share it back with us. Click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1erOQ8qiWmgAmd9WdMLmuBGoxFkUJeQo2c8pc5wFAQbk/copy) to make a new copy of that  directly.  &#x20;

</details>



**Length/time spent:** This is up to you. We welcome detail, elaboration, and technical discussion.

<details>

<summary>Length and time: possible benchmarks</summary>

[The Econometrics society](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/browse/guidelines-referees) recommends a 2–3 page referee report; [Berk et al.](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.31.1.231) suggest this is relatively short, but confirm that brevity is desirable. [In a recent survey (Charness et al., 2022)](https://evalresearch.weebly.com/report---full-text.html), economists report spending (median and mean) about one day per report, with substantial shares reporting "half a day" and "two days." We expect that reviewers tend spend more time on papers for high-status journals, and when reviewing work that is closely tied to their own agenda.

</details>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Adjustments:** We have made some adjustments to this page and to our guidelines and processes; this is particularly relevant for considering earlier evaluations. See [#adjustments-to-metrics-and-guidelines-previous-presentations](why-these-guidelines.md#adjustments-to-metrics-and-guidelines-previous-presentations "mention"). &#x20;
{% endhint %}

Our data protection statement is linked [here](https://bit.ly/46y0LqH).

[^1]: We refer to 'paper or project' here.  We encourage the submission of a range of formats, including dynamic documents. See [dynamic-documents-vs-living-projects](../../../benefits-and-features/dynamic-documents-vs-living-projects/ "mention"). However, we will refer to this as a 'paper'  throughout the discussion below, for simplicity.

[^2]: You may want to glance at these tables before writing your report, to gain a sense of our priorities.

[^3]: Directly or indirectly relevant; e.g., building tools that are likely to contribute to measuring high-impact interventions.

[^4]: Tightly estimated null results can advance the field. In Bayesian terminology, work that “substantially concentrates our posterior belief distributions around the initial expectations” is also highly informative.

[^5]: "Methods" may include choice/collection of data, experiment or survey design, statistical analysis, and simulation, among other elements.

[^6]: E.g., did they give at least a reasonable range of robustness checks? At best, did they ‘map the space’ of possible reasonable specifications in a clear 'multiverse analysis'?

[^7]: Examples of QRP include selective reporting, hypothesizing after results are known, changing methods without reporting, selective reporting of dependent variables, p-hacking, and (uncorrected) opportunistic stopping in data collection. See one relevant discussion [here](https://replicationindex.com/2015/01/24/qrps/).

[^8]: See, e.g., [Open Philanthropy's guide](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/reasoning-transparency/) on reasoning transparency.

[^9]: E.g., does it help us evaluate what to prioritize for interventions and policy, improve interventions and policy, or improve our research and knowledge capacity for these?

[^10]: Here we are asking you about whether i the research was _aimed_ in a way that had strong _potential_ to substantially help solve a high-value problem, or add a lot to global welfare. \
    \
    The Unjournal aims to focus on  research that has this potential, so this also helps us check our own prioritization.

[^11]: E.g., if a paper/project would be most likely to be (or merits being) published in a journal that would rank about halfway between a top tier 'A journal' and a second tier (4/5) journal, you should rate it a 4.5. \
    \
    Similarly, if you think it has an 80%  chance of (being/meriting) publication in a 'marginal B-journal' and a 20% chance of a Top B-journal, you should rate it 2.2.\
    \
    Please also use this continuous scale for providing credible _intervals_.

[^12]: E.g., 1.1 becomes 11, 2.5 becomes 25, 4.3 becomes 43, etc.

[^13]: Please consider the paper in its current form, or with only minor revisions, unless instructed otherwise.

[^14]: Technically, this is referring to the 'Highest Density Interval" (HDI).

[^15]: Technically, this is referring to the 'Highest Density Interval" (HDI), the densest interval of the (posterior) distribution, in Bayesian statistics. Technically, such an interval doesn't need to even contain the midpoint of the distribution, although we will generally assume it does, for our purposes.

[^16]: However, if you don't ask us to publish your name along with your evaluation, we may only report a range-coded version of these, to protect your anonymity.

[^17]: 18 Sep 2023: we intend to summarize the comments in aggregate, but not in a way that you are identifiable.    &#x20;

[^18]: We are replacing the Google Docs with the tailored PubPub interface; the PubPub form should be more efficient and leave less room for misunderstanding. But we will still be flexible to let you link or upload your descriptive, free-form evaluation in whatever form you prefer.
