# Conventional guidelines for referee reports

## **How to write a good review (general conventional guidelines)**

<details>

<summary>Some general key points to consider</summary>

* Cite evidence and reference specific parts of the research when giving feedback.
* Try to justify your critiques and claims in a reasoning-transparent way, rather than merely ‘"passing judgment."
* Provide specific, actionable feedback to the author where possible.
* When considering the authors’ arguments, consider the most reasonable interpretation of what they have written (and state what that is, to help the author make their point more clearly). See [steelmanning](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/steelmanning).
* Be collegial and encouraging, but also rigorous. Criticize and question specific parts of the research without suggesting criticism of the _researchers themselves._

We are happy for you to use whichever process and structure you feel comfortable with when writing a peer review.

<details>

<summary>One possible structure</summary>

_Core_

* _Briefly_ summarize the work in context&#x20;
* Highlight positive aspects of the paper, strengths and contributions, considered in the context of existing research.
* _Most importantly:_ Identify and assess the paper's key claim(s). Are these supported by the evidence provided? Are the assumptions reasonable? Are the authors using appropriate methods?
* Note major limitations and potential ways the work could be improved; where possible, reference methodological literature and discussion and work that models what you are suggesting.

_Optional_

* Discuss minor flaws and their potential revisions.
  * Please don't spend a substantial amount of  time copyediting the work. If you like, you can give a few specific suggestions and then suggest that the author look to make other changes along these lines.
* Offer suggestions for research agendas, increasing the impact of the work, incorporating the work into global priorities research and impact evaluations, and enhancing future work.
* Desirable: formal ['claim identification and assessment'](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mBkAmCVomcUt0Ks7hsxShTsjAbx3WVtFfMCnasGQxns/edit#heading=h.ljcrdyqus3l8)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Remember**: _The Unjournal_ doesn’t “publish” and doesn’t “accept or reject.” So don’t give an _Accept_, _Revise and Resubmit_, or _Reject_-type recommendation. We ask for quantitative metrics, written feedback, and expert discussion of the validity of the paper's main claims, methods, and  assumptions.
