# Our policies: evaluation & workflow

### 1. Project submission, selection and prioritization

People and organizations submit their own research or suggest research they believe may be high-impact. The Unjournal also directly monitors key sources of research and research agendas. Our team then systematically _prioritizes_ this research for evaluation.  _See the link below for further details._

### 2.  Evaluation&#x20;

2. We choose an _evaluation manager_ for each research paper or project. They commission and compensate expert _evaluators_ to rate and discuss the research, following our evaluation template and [guidelines](evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/). The original research authors are given a chance to publicly respond before we post  these evaluations. _See the link below for further details._

[evaluation](evaluation/)
{% endcontent-ref %}



### 3. Communicating results

We make all of this evaluation work public on [our PubPub page](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/), along with an _evaluation summary._ We create DOIs for each element and submit this work to scholarly search engines. We also present a summary and analysis of our [evaluation ratings data](https://unjournal.shinyapps.io/DataExplorer/).&#x20;

\
_We outline some further details in the link below._
