# Policies/issues under discussion

## Considering papers/projects

### Direct-evaluation track: when to proceed with papers that have "R\&R's" at a journal



### Consider 'policy work' not (mainly) intended for academic audiences?

E.g., should we consider evaluating papers put out by organizations like Open Philanthropy, the Happier Lives Institute, or Rethink Priorities that aim at impact but might not be written with academic standards in mind?

## Evaluation procedure and guidelines

### Timing of releasing evaluations

Should we wait until _all_ commissioned evaluations are in, as well as authors' responses, and release these as a group, or should we sometimes release a subset of these if we anticipate a long delay in others? (If we did this, we would still stick by our guarantee to give authors two weeks to respond before release.&#x20;

### Revisit our 'evaluators decide if they want to be anonymous' policy?



## Presenting and hosting our output

### Use of Hypothes.is and collaborative annotation&#x20;
