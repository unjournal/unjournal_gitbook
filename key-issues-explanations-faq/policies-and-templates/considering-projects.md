# Considering projects

## Considering/communicating: **‘Editors’ process**&#x20;

_In deciding which papers/projects to send out to paid reviewers/evaluators, we have considered the following issues._&#x20;

_We will try to communicate this information about each paper/project to reviewers before they write their evaluations. We may hold back some discussion to avoid biasing the reviewers or because of discretion issues._

### Summary, why is it relevant and worth engaging with?

**Consider**: Global priority importance ([what-is-ea-gp-relevant-research.md](../../the-field-and-ea-gp-research/what-is-ea-gp-relevant-research.md "mention")) , field relevance, open science, authors’ engagement, data and reasoning transparency. You may consider the [ITN framework](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework-1), but not too rigidly. See our [guidelines-for-evaluators.md](guidelines-for-evaluators.md "mention") for more discussion.



### **Why does it need (more) review, and what are some key issues and claims to vet?**

What are (some of) the authors’ main important claims that are worth carefully evaluating? What aspects of the evidence, argumentation, methods, interpretation, etc., are you unsure about? What particular data, code, proof, etc., would you like to see vetted. If it has already been peer-reviewed in some way, why do you think more review is needed?

### **Author engagement**

How well has the author engaged with the process? Do they need particular convincing? Do they need help making their engagement with the Unjournal successful?
