# Dynamic documents vs 'living projects'

By “**Dynamic Documents**” I mean papers/projects built with R-markdown or JuPyTer notebooks (the 2 most prominent tools) that do and report the data analysis (as well as math/simulations) in the same space that the results and discussion are presented (with ‘code blocks’ hidden).

I consider some of the benefits of this format, particularly for EA-aligned organizations like Open Philanthropy: [benefits-of-dynamic-documents.md](benefits-of-dynamic-documents.md "mention")

**Living projects:**

\*\*\*\* “Continually update a project” rather than start a “new extension paper” when you see what you could have done better.

The main idea is that each version is given a specific time stamp, and that is the object that is reviewed and cited. This is more or less already the case when we cite working papers/drafts/mimeos/preprints.

**See** [#living-kaizend-research-projects](living-research-projects.md#living-kaizend-research-projects "mention"), further discussing the potential benefits
