    <p>These are some of the operationalized questions from our <a href="https://coda.io/d/Unjournal-Public-Pages_ddIEzDONWdb/Wellbeing-PQ_suPg8sEH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wellbeing Pivotal Questions project</a>. We want to elicit expert and stakeholder beliefs—before, during, and after reviewing the evidence—to see how views evolve and where consensus exists or doesn't.</p>

    <p>You don't need to be a specialist to contribute. We want your honest assessment and reasoning, whether you feel highly confident or very uncertain. Your input helps us understand the range of views in the field.</p>

    <p>Three of these questions will also appear on our <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/c/unjournal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaculus forecasting page</a> (coming soon). If you forecast on Metaculus, please share your username below so we can link your contributions.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>For probability/percentage questions:</strong> Give your best estimate. If very uncertain, a wide range is fine—that's useful information too.</li>
        <li><strong>For open-ended questions:</strong> Even a sentence or two helps. We're looking for reasoning and considerations, not polished analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>You can return and update</strong> your responses as your views evolve. (Note: We will store each submission separately rather than overwriting previous responses.)</li>

            <li>For comparing <em>changes</em> in wellbeing across interventions, what matters most is whether differences on the scale are comparable across individuals—not necessarily whether absolute levels have the same meaning.</li>
            <li>Benjamin et al. (2023) found substantial scale-use heterogeneity. They show that calibration questions can adjust for roughly 30–50% of this heterogeneity in their sample, though generalizability remains uncertain.</li>

        <h2 class="pq-question">If the impact of one program is measured in WELLBYs [...] and another program impact is measured in DALYs [or QALYs], [...] what is the best numerical conversion or mapping between them?</h2>
        <p class="pq-subtext">From <a href="https://coda.io/d/Unjournal-Public-Pages_ddIEzDONWdb/Wellbeing-PQ_suPg8sEH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DALY_01</a>: "If the impact of one program is measured in WELLBYs (as defined above) and another program impact is measured in DALYs, and we have a reported effect size and standard deviation for each, what is the best numerical conversion or mapping between them?" <em>(Note: QALYs may be more relevant than DALYs for this conversion—see context.)</em></p>
        <p class="pq-why">Organizations currently treat 1 SD of improvement on mental health instruments as roughly equivalent to 1 SD on the WELLBY scale. The UK Treasury uses ~1 QALY ≈ 6-7 WELLBYs. Getting this conversion wrong means systematically over- or under-investing in mental health versus physical health interventions.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>DALY vs QALY:</strong> DALYs measure health burden (years lost to disease/disability); QALYs measure health gained. For conversion purposes, QALYs are often more directly comparable—the canonical questions note "replace DALY with QALY" may be appropriate.</li>
            <li>Currently, standard practice (used by HLI and Founders Pledge) treats SDs on different mental health instruments as interconvertible with WELLBY SDs on a roughly 1:1 basis.</li>
            <li>The conversion between DALYs/QALYs and WELLBYs depends on the "neutral point" on the LS scale—the point below which life has negative value. This is currently unknown; one small study (Peasgood et al. 2018) suggested LS ≈ 2, but this is tentative.</li>
            <li>The relationship may also be non-linear—e.g., a WELLBY gained at very low wellbeing could be worth more than one gained at high wellbeing.</li>

Where will [this] approach be particularly incorrect?"</p>
        <p class="pq-why">Funders need a usable conversion now, even if imperfect. The question is whether the current approach (SD equivalence) is defensible, or whether a better practical method exists.</p>
