  <div class="beliefs-intro">
    <p>These are some of the <strong>key</strong> operationalized questions from our Wellbeing Pivotal Questions project. We want to elicit expert and stakeholder beliefs—before, during, and after reviewing the evidence—to see how views evolve and where consensus exists or doesn't. <em>(All questions are optional.)</em></p>

    <div class="canonical-callout">
      <strong>📋 Full question specifications:</strong> For more detail, context, and the complete set of operationalized questions, see the <a href="https://coda.io/d/Unjournal-Public-Pages_ddIEzDONWdb/Wellbeing-PQ_suPg8sEH#_luVrD0mE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canonical Wellbeing PQ formulations on Coda →</a>

    <p>You don't need to be a specialist to contribute. We want your honest assessment and reasoning, whether you feel highly confident or very uncertain. Your input helps us understand the range of views in the field.</p>

    <p>Three of these questions will also appear on our <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/c/unjournal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaculus forecasting page</a> (coming soon). If you forecast on Metaculus, please share your username below so we can link your contributions.</p>

      <div class="guidance-callout-title">How to respond</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>For probability/percentage questions:</strong> Give your best estimate. If very uncertain, a wide range is fine—that's useful information too.</li>
        <li><strong>For open-ended questions:</strong> Even a sentence or two helps. We're looking for reasoning and considerations, not polished analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>You can return and update</strong> your responses as your views evolve. (Note: We will store each submission separately rather than overwriting previous responses.)</li>
        <li><strong>Note on DALYs vs QALYs:</strong> These questions focus on DALYs as the comparison metric. If you think the QALY comparison is more relevant, please note that in your response.</li>

          <p>The "best" mappings would be those that, if used to make conversions between WELLBYs, DALYs, etc., would be likely to lead to the better/best decisions in most relevant situations.</p>

            <li>Some organizations (including HLI and Founders Pledge) currently treat SDs on different mental health instruments as interconvertible with WELLBY SDs on a roughly 1:1 basis.</li>
            <li>The conversion between DALYs/QALYs and WELLBYs depends on the "neutral point" on the LS scale—the point below which life has negative value. This is currently unknown; one small study (Peasgood et al. 2018) suggested LS ≈ 2, but this is tentative.</li>
            <li>The relationship may also be non-linear—e.g., a WELLBY gained at very low wellbeing could be worth more than one gained at high wellbeing.</li>
