    <h2>The question</h2>

    <p>Animal welfare funders face a strategic question: should they invest in reducing the cost and improving the quality of plant-based alternatives (PBAs), or focus on other interventions like corporate welfare campaigns? The answer depends heavily on a factual question that's surprisingly hard to answer: <strong>how much do plant-based products actually substitute for animal products?</strong></p>

    <p>If a 10% price reduction in Impossible Burgers leads many people to eat fewer chickens, that's a strong case for funding PBA development. If people who buy plant-based burgers are mostly substituting away from beef (not chicken), or if PBA buyers were already eating less meat, the case weakens considerably.</p>

    <h2>Why this is hard to measure</h2>

    <p>Cross-price elasticities—how demand for one product changes when the price of another changes—are notoriously difficult to estimate reliably, especially in this context:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selection effects:</strong> People who buy PBAs may systematically differ from those who don't, making observational comparisons misleading.</li>
      <li><strong>Endogeneity:</strong> PBA prices may change for reasons correlated with meat demand (e.g., both driven by changing consumer preferences).</li>
      <li><strong>Hypothetical vs. real behavior:</strong> Survey-based choice experiments may not reflect actual purchasing decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Complement vs. substitute:</strong> Some studies find PBAs are <em>complements</em> to certain meats (demand moves together), while others find substitution effects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The evidence landscape</h2>

    <p>We've identified approximately 15 relevant empirical papers using various methods:</p>

    <div class="question-cards">
      <div class="question-card">
        <h3 class="question-card-title">Scanner data studies</h3>
        <p class="question-card-text">Using grocery purchase data (Nielsen, IRI) to estimate demand systems and cross-price elasticities. Methods include AIDS/QAIDS models, though identification strategies vary in rigor.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question-card">
        <h3 class="question-card-title">Hypothetical choice experiments</h3>
        <p class="question-card-text">Survey-based discrete choice experiments asking consumers to choose between product bundles at different prices. Useful for scenarios not yet observed, but may not reflect real behavior.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question-card">
        <h3 class="question-card-title">Event studies</h3>
        <p class="question-card-text">Examining what happens to meat purchases when households first buy PBAs. Useful descriptively, but causal interpretation requires strong assumptions about timing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question-card">
        <h3 class="question-card-title">Field experiments</h3>
        <p class="question-card-text">Randomized interventions in retail settings (e.g., moving PBAs to the meat aisle). Limited studies exist, but these offer the strongest causal evidence.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>What we want to achieve</h2>

    <p>This workshop brings together agricultural economists, animal welfare researchers, and funders to:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Review the evidence:</strong> Which studies are most credible? What can we actually conclude about substitution effects?</li>
      <li><strong>Quantify uncertainty:</strong> What's a reasonable range for the cross-price elasticity between PBAs and chicken?</li>
      <li><strong>Connect to decisions:</strong> Given current evidence, is PBA funding plausibly competitive with corporate campaigns?</li>
      <li><strong>Identify research gaps:</strong> What study would most reduce uncertainty? Is it feasible?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Preliminary agenda</h2>

    <p><em>Note: This agenda is preliminary and will be refined based on participant input.</em></p>

    <p>The workshop is planned for approximately <strong>2.5 hours online</strong>, with segments designed for flexibility:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Stakeholder Context</strong> (~20 min) — Why ACE and funders care about this question; current funding landscape</li>
      <li><strong>Evidence Review</strong> (~45 min) — Overview of key studies; methodological strengths and limitations</li>
      <li><strong>Substitution Impact Discussion</strong> (~45 min) — Deep-dive on the focal question: effect of 10% PBA price reduction on chicken consumption</li>
      <li><strong>Animal Welfare ROI Panel</strong> (~30 min) — Comparing PBA funding to alternatives; decision-relevant thresholds</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Pivotal Questions</h2>

    <p>We've operationalized the key uncertainties into specific, answerable questions. These include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>PBA_01 (Focal):</strong> If the price of high-quality plant-based hamburgers fell by 10%, how would global chicken consumption change?</li>
      <li><strong>PBA_02:</strong> Is PBA research a good investment from an animal welfare perspective?</li>
      <li><strong>PBA_03:</strong> Does the AW benefit of $100K to GFI exceed $100K to THL corporate campaigns?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Several of these are posted on <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/c/unjournal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaculus</a> for community forecasting.</p>
