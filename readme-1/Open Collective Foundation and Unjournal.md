# Followup meeting and questions (9 June 2023)

1. Please remind me where do I go for information/documentation on OCF?
	1. [Onboarding Video](https://www.loom.com/share/e7c8245251784196a6dde4f49cb3ab2a)
	2. [Documentation](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/)

2. . Best way to correspond with questions?
	1. Best way is to email  contact@opencollective.foundation (3 business days). 
	2. [OCF's slack channel if urgent](https://join.slack.com/share/enQtNTQwMTgyNDYyOTU3MS1jYTg4MWQ5YjkxZTNlZDUxZTA0MjdiY2Q2OTRmMzYzM2EzYjgwMmU0ZDg1YTM4OTQ1NDg0MDVmOWNkZTU0ZDVi?cdn_fallback=1) #ocf   
	3.  Support issues/tickets record?: nothing users can view yet
	4. OC vs OCF?  (OCF is under OC; go to OCF for most things, maybe to OC only for questions on the overriding web page platform. If you use the 'help' on the page it takes you to OC -- usually better to email OCF)
    

3. Transfer of funds to Unjournal (June 2023)
	1. What more do I need to do, if anything?
    
2. What is the OCF/OC fee on this?
    

5. Transfer of funds (contract payment) to EAMT … what’s the status, how could we have done this more efficiently?
    
6. In general, I want to better understand the processes of ‘doing financial and legal things through OCF” 
    
7. Information about hiring and benefits through OC/OCF
	1. There was another resource for this? I can’t remember; maybe it’s linked in the other docs?
    
8. Use OCF mailing address (for mailchimp etc)
    
9. Purchasing software through account
    
10. Other advising (legal, data protection)?**
