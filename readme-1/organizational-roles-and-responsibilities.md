# Organizational roles and responsibilities

## **Management Committee Members**

Activities may involve a combination of the following (but you can choose your focus).

* Contributing to the decision-making process regarding research focus, reviewer assignment, and prize distribution.
* (In your area of interest and expertise...) Keeping track of new or under-considered research with potential for impact. Explain and assess its potential for Unjournal evaluation.
* Collaborating with other committee members on the establishment of rules and guidelines, such as determining the metrics for research evaluation and defining the mode of assessment publication.
* Helping plan The Unjournal’s future path.

**Time commitment**: A minimum of 20 hours total over the next 18 months.

**Compensation**: We have funding for a $57.50 per hour honorarium for the first 20 hours, with possible compensation [for additional work](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. [Evaluation management work](../management-tech-details-discussion/management-process/) will be further compensated (at roughly $300–$450 per paper).

**Who we are looking for**: All applicants are welcome. We are especially interested in those involved in global priorities research (and related fields), policy research and practice, open science and meta-science, bibliometrics and scholarly publishing, and any other academic research. We want individuals with a solid interest in The Unjournal project and its goals, and the ability to meet the minimal time commitment. Applying is extremely quick, and those not chosen will be considered for other roles and work going forward.



## **Advisory Board Members (ABM)**&#x20;

Beyond the direct roles within the Unjournal, we're building a larger, more passive advisory board to be part of our network, to offer occasional feedback and guidance, and to act as an evaluation manager (see our [evaluation workflow](../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/mapping-evaluation-workflow.md)) when needed.

There is essentially no minimum time commitment for the Advisory Board members; only opportunities to engage..  We sketch some of the expectations in the fold below

<details>

<summary>Advisory Board members: expectations (sketch: Aug. 15, 2023)</summary>

_As an Advisory Board member..._

* You agree to be listed on our page as being on the advisory board
* You have the option (but not the expectation or requirement) to join our Slack, and to check in once in a while
* We will  you in for your input on some decisions surrounding The Unjournal's policies and direction&#x20;
  * Probably through the "Loomio.com" tool ... maybe 1x per month, and you are not obligated to respond;
* &#x20;We may have occasional video meetings in which members of the AB are invited (again optional)
* You are “in our system” and we may consult you for other work&#x20;
* We will compensate you for anything that takes you a substantial amount of your time that does not overlap with your regular work.

## **Field Specialists (FS)**

FSs will focus on a particular area of research, policy, or impactful outcome. They will keep track of new or under-considered research with potential for impact. They will explain and assess the extent to which The Unjournal can add value by commissioning its evaluation. They will 'curate' this and may also serve as evaluation managers for this work.

{% hint style="success" %}
We expect most FSs to be on the Advisory Board, and vice versa. However, the Venn diagram is not a circle. Some ABMs may not have a relevant research focus, and some FSs may choose not to be listed on our Advisory Board.
{% endhint %}

**Time commitment**: There is no specific time obligation; only opportunities to engage. We may also occasionally consult you on your areas of expertise. (Perhaps 1-4 hours a month is a reasonable starting expectation.)

**Compensation:** Will vary on a case-by-case basis. In general, we aim to fairly compensate people for work done to support The Unjournal. [Evaluation management work](../management-tech-details-discussion/management-process/) will be compensated at roughly $300–$450 per project.

**Who we are looking for**: For the FS roles, we are seeking active researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders with a strong publication record and/or involvement in the research and/or research-linked policy and prioritization processes. For the Advisory Board, also people with connections to academia, governmental, or relevant non-profit institutions, and/or involvement in open science, publication, and research evaluation processes. People who can offer relevant advice, experience, guidance, or help communicate our goals, processes, and progress.

<summary>Sketch (15 Aug 2024): If you become a field specialist, what happens next?</summary>

You will be asked to fill out [this survey](https://airtable.com/appbPYEw9nURln7Qg/shr18RefpzAKNtfhC) to let us know what fields, topics, and sources of research you would like to 'monitor' or dig into to help identify and curate work relevant for Unjournal evaluation, as well as outlining your areas of expertise (the form takes maybe 5–20 minutes).

This helps us understand when to contact you to ask if you want to be  'Evaluation Manager' or a paper we have prioritized for evaluation.

Guided by this survey form (and discussing this with you, and coordinating with the team) we come up with an “assignment.” ... for 'this is the area you will be covering/monitoring',  to help us divide up the space and not overlap.  This can be as large or small as you like.&#x20;

Within this area, you keep a record of the research that seems relevant (and why, and what particularly needs evaluation… ) and enter it in our database (or you pass your notes to us and we enter it) …

We compensate you for the time you spend on this (details tbd),  particularly for time you spend on this project to the extent that it is not contributing to your other work/research.

\
Estimated time commitment (FS): 1–4 hours per month (for people already involved in doing and/or using research), plus potential additional paid assignments.

We invite you to fill in this [form](https://airtable.com/shrW9xpIrxNGfxkXW) to leave your contact information, as well as outlining which parts of the project you may be interested in.

_Note_: This is under continual refinement; see our [policies](../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/) for more details.

[^1]: Our current budget covers an average of roughly 80 total hours per Management Committee member at this rate.
