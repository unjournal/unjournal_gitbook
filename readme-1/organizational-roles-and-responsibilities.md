# Organizational roles and responsibilities

## **Management Committee Members**

Activities of those on the Management Committee may involve a combination of the following (although you can choose your focus):

* Contributing to the decision-making process regarding research focus, reviewer assignment, and prize distribution.
* Keeping track of new or under-considered research with potential for impact in your area of interest and expertise. Explain and assess its potential for _Unjournal_ evaluation.
* Collaborating with other committee members on the establishment of rules and guidelines, such as determining the metrics for research evaluation and defining the mode of assessment publication.
* Helping plan _The Unjournal_’s future path.

**Time commitment**: A minimum of 20 hours total over the next 18 months.

**Compensation**: We have funding for a $57.50 per hour honorarium for the first 20 hours, with possible compensation [for additional work](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. [Evaluation management work](../management-tech-details-discussion/management-process/) will be further compensated (at roughly $300–$450 per paper).

**Who we are looking for**: All applicants are welcome. We are especially interested in those involved in global priorities research (and related fields), policy research and practice, open science and meta-science, bibliometrics and scholarly publishing, and any other academic research. We want individuals with a solid interest in _The Unjournal_ project and its goals, and the ability to meet the minimal time commitment. Applying is extremely quick, and those not chosen will be considered for other roles and work going forward.

## **Advisory Board (AB) Members**&#x20;

Beyond direct roles within _The Unjournal_, we're building a larger, more passive advisory board to be part of our network, to offer occasional feedback and guidance, and to act as an evaluation manager, when needed (see our [evaluation workflow](../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/mapping-evaluation-workflow.md)).

There is essentially no minimum time commitment for Advisory Board members—only opportunities to engage.  We sketch some of the expectations in the fold below.

<details>

<summary>Advisory Board members: expectations (sketch: Aug. 15, 2023)</summary>

_As an Advisory Board member..._

* you agree to be listed on our page as being on the advisory board.
* you have the option (but not the expectation or requirement) to join our Slack, and to check in once in a while.
* you will be looped in for your input on some decisions surrounding _The Unjournal_'s policies and direction. Such communucations might occur once per month, and you are not obligated to respond. (This will probably be accomplished through the Loomio.com tool.)&#x20;
* you may be invited to occasional video meetings (again optional).
* you are “in our system” and we may consult you for other work.&#x20;
* you will be compensated for anything that requires a substantial amount of your time that does not overlap with your regular work.

## **Field Specialists (FS)**

FSs will focus on a particular area of research, policy, or impactful outcome. They will keep track of new or under-considered research with potential for impact and explain and assess the extent to which _The Unjournal_ can add value by commissioning its evaluation. They will "curate" this research and may also serve as evaluation managers for this work.

{% hint style="success" %}
We expect most FSs will be on the Advisory Board, and vice versa. However, the Venn diagram is not a circle: some AB members may not have a relevant research focus, and some FSs may choose not to be listed on our Advisory Board.
{% endhint %}

**Time commitment**: There is no specific time obligation—only opportunities to engage. We may also consult you occasionally on your areas of expertise. Perhaps 1–4 hours a month is a reasonable starting expectation for people already involved in doing or using research, plus potential additional paid assignments.

**Compensation:** This will vary on a case-by-case basis. As a rule, we aim to fairly compensate people for work done to support _The Unjournal_. [Evaluation management work](../management-tech-details-discussion/management-process/) will be compensated at roughly $300–$450 per project.

**Who we are looking for**: For the FS roles, we are seeking active researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders with a strong publication record and/or involvement in the research and/or research-linked policy and prioritization processes. For the Advisory Board, also people with connections to academic, governmental, or relevant non-profit institutions, and/or involvement in open science, publication, and research evaluation processes. People who can offer relevant advice, experience, guidance, or help communicate our goals, processes, and progress.

<summary>Sketch (15 Aug 2024): <em>If you become a field specialist, what happens next?</em></summary>

You will be asked to fill out [this survey](https://airtable.com/appbPYEw9nURln7Qg/shr18RefpzAKNtfhC) to let us know what fields, topics, and sources of research you would like to "monitor" or dig into to help identify and curate work relevant for _Unjournal_ evaluation, as well as outlining your areas of expertise (the form takes perhaps 5–20 minutes).

This survey helps us understand when to contact you to ask if you want to be an evaluation manager on a paper we have prioritized for evaluation.

Guided by this survey form (along with discussions we will have with you, and coordination with the team), we will come up with an “assignment” that specifies the area you will be covering. We will make an effort to divide up the space and not overlap between field specialists. This scope can be as broad or focused as you like.&#x20;

Within your area, you keep a record of the research that seems relevant (and why, and what particularly needs evaluation, etc.) and enter it in our database. (Alternatively, you can pass your notes to us for recording.)

We compensate you for the time you spend on this process (details tbd), particularly to the extent that time you spend does not contribute to your other work or research.

## Contact us

If you are interested in discussing any of the above in person, please email us ([theunjournal@gmail.com](mailto:theunjournal@gmail.com)) to arrange a conversation.

We invite you to fill in [this form](https://airtable.com/shrtMv4hNlv8aL7Yy) (the same as that linked above) to leave your contact information and outline which parts of the project interest you.

_Note_: These descriptions are under continual refinement; see our [policies](../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/) for more details.

[^1]: Our current budget covers an average of roughly 80 total hours per Management Committee member at this rate.
