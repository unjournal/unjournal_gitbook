# Plan of action

{% hint style="info" %}
What is _The Unjournal_? See [our summary](./#in-a-nutshell).
{% endhint %}

## Current focus

The Unjournal's pilot phase was completed in August 2023. We are now focused on:

1. **Scaling evaluation coverage** — Expanding the volume and range of research we evaluate
2. **Building field specialist teams** — Recruiting experts to monitor and prioritize research in key areas
3. **Improving evaluation processes** — Refining our metrics, guidelines, and workflow
4. **Demonstrating value** — Building evidence that Unjournal evaluations provide useful signals about research quality

See the vision and broad plan presented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C5CE8X_rgGEZnewdKFsbxSGw7l0PxmQvr8F4tv7ege8/edit):

### What the pilot needed to demonstrate

1. We actually **"do something."**
2. We can provide **credible reviews and ratings** that have value as measures of research quality comparable to (or better than) traditional journal systems.
3. We identify important work that **informs global priorities.**
4. We boost work in innovative and transparent and replicable formats (especially **dynamic documents**).
5. **Authors engage** with our process and find it useful.
6. (As a push) Universities, grantmakers, and other arbiters **assign value** to _Unjournal_ ratings.

### Original planning milestones

See our [original grant proposal](../grants-and-proposals/acx-ltff-grant-proposal-as-submitted-successfull/) for the detailed 12-month plan we followed during the pilot.

Key elements completed:
- ✅ Built founding committee of experienced researchers
- ✅ Defined scope and principles
- ✅ Set up platforms (moved from Kotahi/Sciety to PubPub)
- ✅ Created submission and evaluation rules
- ✅ Completed pilot evaluations (10 papers, 21 evaluations)
