## Update on recent progress: 28 August 2023

### Pilot = completed!

With the [completed set of evaluations of "Do Celebrity Endorsements Matter? A Twitter Experiment Promoting Vaccination In Indonesia"](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/alatasevalsum/release/1?readingCollection=02bc1831) and ["The Governance Of Non-Profits And Their Social Impact: Evidence From A Randomized Program In Healthcare In DRC](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/eval-sum-governance-nonprofits/release/3)” our pilot is complete:

* 10 research papers evaluated
* 21 evaluations
* 5 author responses&#x20;

You can see this output most concisely [in our PubPub collection here](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/evaluation-summary-and-metrics) (evaluations are listed as 'supplements').

For a continuously-updated overview of our process, including the evaluation metrics see our 'data journalism' notebook [hosted here](https://unjournal.github.io/unjournaldata/chapters/evaluation\_data\_analysis.html#basic-presentation).&#x20;

Remember, we assign individual DOI's to all of these outputs (evaluation, responses, manager syntheses), and aim to get these into all bibliometrics and scholarly databases. So far Google Scholar [has picked up _one of our outputs._](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en\&as\_sdt=0%2C22\&q=source%3A%22the+unjournal%22\&btnG=\&oq=unjo) (The Google Scholar algorithm is a bit opaque – your tips are welcome).&#x20;

#### Following up on the pilot

We will make decisions and award our pilot [Impactful Research Prize](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/readme-1/call-for-participants-research/impactful-research-prize) and evaluator prizes soon (aiming for end-of-September). The winners will be determined by a consensus of our management team and advisory board (potentially consulting external expertise). The choices will be largely driven by the ratings and predictions given by _Unjournal_ evaluators. After we make the choices, we will make our decision process public and transparent.

Following this we are considering holding an online seminar/discussion and prize ceremony. Authors and (non-anonymous) evaluators will be invited to discuss their work and take questions.  We are aiming to partner with other organizations in academia and in the impactful-research and open-science spaces. If this goes well, we may make it the start of a regular thing.

_We will also follow up on:_

* Evaluators' and authors' comments on our process, and how we can make it better
* Analyzing the evaluation metrics for patterns, potential biases, and reliability measures
* 'Aggregating expert judgment' from these metrics
* Tracking future outcomes to benchmark these metrics&#x20;
* Drawing insights from evaluation _content_, communicating these (to policymakers etc.)



## The Big Scale-Up&#x20;

### Evaluating more research: Prioritization&#x20;

We continue to develop processes and policies around "which research to prioritize." For example, we are considering and discussing whether we should set targets for different fields, for related outcome "cause categories," and for research sources. We intend to open up this discussion to the public to bring in a range of perspectives and experience. We are working towards a grounded framework and a systematic process to make these decisions. See our expanding notes and discussion on [What is global-priorities relevant research?](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/b1RpEkRWWqZAV4SlrFCt/the-field-and-ea-gp-research)

We are still inviting applications for the [paid standalone project h](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MBKQx8RNqvxMcJPBt4cXtjQ8SUm4OIwJc8O1Jr65QSQ/edit#heading=h.g1g4xbvds9au)elping us do this...

_Our next steps on this:_&#x20;

1. Building our frameworks and principles for prioritizing research to be evaluated, a coherent approach to implementing this, and a process for weighing and reassessing these choices. We will incorporate previous approaches and a range of feedback. For a window into our thinking so far, see our '[high level considerations](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/considering-projects/what-research-to-target#high-level-considerations-for-considering-research)' and our [practical prioritization concerns and goals](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/considering-projects/what-research-to-target#prioritizing-research-to-achieve-these-goals).
2.  Building research-scoping teams of field specialists. These will consider agendas in different fields, subfields, and methods (psychology, RCT-linked development economics, etc.) and for different topics and outcomes (global health, attitudes towards animal welfare, social consequences of AI, etc.) We begin to lay out [possible teams and discussions here ](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/management-tech-details-discussion/research-scoping-discussion-spaces)(the linked discussion spaces are private for now, but we aim to make things public whenever it's feasible). These 'field teams' will&#x20;

    * discuss and report on the state of research in these areas (including 'where and when it is posted publicly'),&#x20;
    * the potential for _Unjournal_ evaluation of this work (and when and how we should evaluate it, considering potential variations from our basic approach),
    * how to _prioritize_ work in this area for evaluation (reporting general guidelines and principles, informing the aforementioned frameworks.&#x20;

    Most concretely, they will 'divide up the space of research work' to be scoped and prioritized among the members of these teams.

### Growing _The Unjournal_ Team

Our previous call for Field Specialists is still active. We got a lot of great applications and interest, and we plan to send out invitations soon. But the door is still open to express interest! &#x20;

_New members of our team_: Welcome [Rosie Bettle (Founder's Pledge)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosie-bettle-84a1051b0/) to our Advisory Board, as a Field Specialist.



### Improving the evaluation process and metrics

As part of our scaleup (and conjunction with supporting [PubPub](https://www.pubpub.org/) on their redesigned platform), we're hoping to improve our evaluation procedure and our evaluation metrics. We want to make these clearer to evaluators, more reliable and consistent, and more useful and informative to policymakers and other researchers (including meta-analysts).&#x20;

We don't want to reinvent the wheel (unless we can make it a bit more round).  We will be informed by previous work, such as:&#x20;

* existing research into the research evaluation process, and on expert judgment elicitation and aggregation&#x20;
* practices from projects like RepliCATS/IDEAS, PREreview BITSS Open Policy Analysis, the “Four validities” in research design, etc.&#x20;
* metrics used (e.g., 'risk of bias') in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and databases such as [3ie's Development Evidence Portal](https://developmentevidence.3ieimpact.org/)

Of course, our context, and our goals are somewhat distinct from the initiatives above.

We also aim to consult potential _users_ of our evaluations as to which metrics _they_ would find most helpful.&#x20;

(A semi-aside: The choice of metrics and emphases could also empower efforts to encourage researchers to more consistently report policy-relevant parameters.)

We aim to bring a range of researchers and practitioners into these questions, as well as  engaging in _public_ discussion. Please reach out.&#x20;



### "Spilling tea"

Yes, I was on a podcast, but I still put my trousers on one leg at a time, just like everyone else!  Thanks to Will Ngiam for inviting me (David Reinstein) on "[ReproducibiliTea](https://soundcloud.com/reproducibilitea)" to talk about "Revolutionizing Scientific Publishing" (or maybe 'evolutionizing' ... if that's a word?). I think I did a decent job of making the case for The Unjournal, in some detail. Also, find out what to do if you are trapped in a dystopian skating rink! (And does this have to do with 'advising young academics'.)

I hope to do more of this: I'm happy to go on podcasts and other forums and answer questions about _The Unjournal_, respond to doubts you may have, and consider your suggestions and discuss alternative initiatives.
