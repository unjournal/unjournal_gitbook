## Update on recent progress: 28 August 2023

### Pilot = completed!

With the [completed set of evaluations of "Do Celebrity Endorsements Matter? A Twitter Experiment Promoting Vaccination In Indonesia"](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/alatasevalsum/release/1?readingCollection=02bc1831) and ["The Governance Of Non-Profits And Their Social Impact: Evidence From A Randomized Program In Healthcare In DRC](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/eval-sum-governance-nonprofits/release/3)” our pilot is complete:

* 10 research papers evaluated
* 21 evaluations
* 5 author responses&#x20;

You can see this output most concisely [in our PubPub collection here](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/evaluation-summary-and-metrics) (evaluations are listed as 'supplements').

For a continuously-updated overview of our process, including the evaluation metrics see our 'data journalism' notebook [hosted here](https://unjournal.github.io/unjournaldata/chapters/evaluation\_data\_analysis.html#basic-presentation).&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Just a peek at the content you can find in our lovely data notebook!</p></figcaption></figure>



Remember, we assign individual DOI's to all of these outputs (evaluation, responses, manager syntheses), and aim to get these into all bibliometrics and scholarly databases. So far Google Scholar [has picked up _one of our outputs._](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en\&as\_sdt=0%2C22\&q=source%3A%22the+unjournal%22\&btnG=\&oq=unjo)

#### Following up on the pilot

We will make decisions and award our pilot [Impactful Research Prize](call-for-participants-research/impactful-research-prize/) and evaluator prizes soon (aiming at end-of-September). The winners will be determined by a consensus of our management team and advisory board (potentially consulting external expertise). The choices will be largely driven by the ratings and predictions given by _Unjournal_ evaluators. After we make the choices, we will make our decision process public and transparent.

Following this we are considering holding an online seminar and prize ceremony; we are aiming to partner with other organizations in the impactful-research and open-science spaces.

We will also follow up on:

* Evaluators' and authors' comments and discussion on our process, and how we can make it better
* Analyzing the evaluation metrics to look for underlying patterns, potential biases, and reliability measures
* 'Aggregating expert judgment' from these metrics
* Tracking future outcomes to benchmark these metrics&#x20;
* Drawing insights from the evaluation _content_, and communicating this to policymakers and philanthropists.



## The Big Scale-Up&#x20;

### Evaluating more research: Prioritization&#x20;

We continue to develop processes and policies around "which research to prioritize." For example, we are considering whether we should set targets for different fields, for related outcome "cause categories," and for research sources. This discussion continues among our team and with stakeholders. We intend to open up the discussion further, making it public and bringing in a range of voices. The objective is to develop a framework and a systematic process to make these decisions. See our expanding notes and discussion on [What is global-priorities relevant research?](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/b1RpEkRWWqZAV4SlrFCt/the-field-and-ea-gp-research)

We are still inviting applications for the [paid standalone project h](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MBKQx8RNqvxMcJPBt4cXtjQ8SUm4OIwJc8O1Jr65QSQ/edit#heading=h.g1g4xbvds9au)elping us do this

_Our next steps: Building research-scoping teams and agendas_

### Building our team, inviting input and collaboration

Our previous call for Field specialists is still active. We got a lot of great applications and interest, and we plan to send out invitations soon. But the door is still open. &#x20;

_New members of our team_: Welcome [Rosie Bettle (Founder's Pledge)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosie-bettle-84a1051b0/) to our Advisory Board, as a Field Specialist.
