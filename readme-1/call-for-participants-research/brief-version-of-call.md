# Brief version of call

I (David Reinstein) am an economist who left UK academia after 15 years to pursue a range of projects ([see my web page](http://davidreinstein.org/)). One of these is [_The Unjournal_](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/):

> _The Unjournal_ (with funding from the [Long Term Future Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future) and the Survival and Flourishing Fund) organizes and funds public-journal-independent feedback and evaluation, paying reviewers for their work. We focus on research that is highly relevant to global priorities, especially in economics, social science, and impact evaluation. We encourage better research by making it easier for researchers to get feedback and credible ratings on their work.

### **Evaluators**

We want researchers who are interested in doing evaluation work for _The Unjournal_. We pay [$400 per complete and on-time ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]evaluation, and we will award further monetary prizes for the most informative evaluations. Right now we are particularly looking for economists and people with quantitative and policy-evaluation skills. We describe what we are asking evaluators to do [here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/policies-and-templates/guideline-for-evaluators): essentially a regular peer review with some different emphases, plus providing a set of quantitative ratings and predictions. Your evaluation content would be made public (and receive a DOI, etc.), but you can choose if you want to remain anonymous or not.

_To sign up to be part of the pool of evaluators or to get involved in_ The Unjournal _project in other ways, please_ [_fill out this brief form_](https://airtable.com/shrW9xpIrxNGfxkXW) _or contact theunjournal@gmail.com._

### **Research**

We welcome suggestions for particularly impactful research that would benefit from (further) public evaluation. We choose research for public evaluation based on an initial assessment of methodological strength, openness, clarity, relevance to [global priorities](../../readme/call-for-participants-research/broken-reference/), and the usefulness of further evaluation and public discussion. We sketch out [these criteria here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/policies-and-templates/considering-projects), and give some potential examples [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see#Some\_suggested\_\_sort\_of\_things\_we\_might\_be\_looking\_for\_).

If you have research—your own or others—that you would like us to assess, please fill out [_this form_](https://airtable.com/shrdHHI0zK7rkJCP3). You can submit your own work [here](https://unjournaldev.cloud68.co/login) (or by contacting [contact@unjournal.org](https://app.gitbook.com/u/Kb2a1KdsgsTOM7ZYPPCIyGkho3Q2)). _Authors_ of evaluated papers will be eligible for our [Impactful Research Prizes](impactful-research-prize/) (Pilot phase prizes: $2500, $1000. Post-pilot prizes are likely to be larger.

### **Feedback**

We are looking for both feedback on and involvement in _The Unjournal_ project. Feel free to reach out at [contact@unjournal.org](https://app.gitbook.com/u/Kb2a1KdsgsTOM7ZYPPCIyGkho3Q2).
