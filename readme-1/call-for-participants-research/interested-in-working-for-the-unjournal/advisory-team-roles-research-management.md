# Advisory/team roles (research, management)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Nov. 2023**: We are currently prioritizing bringing in more [field specialists](../../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities/#field-specialists-fs) to build our teams in a few areas, particularly in:&#x20;

* Catastrophic risks, AI governance and safety
* Animal welfare: markets, attitudes



As well as:

* Quantitative political science (voting, lobbying, attitudes)
* Social impact of AI/emerging technologies
* Macro/growth, finance, public finance
* Long term trends and demographics
{% endhint %}

In addition to the "work roles," we are looking to engage researchers, research users, meta-scientists, and people with experience in open science, open access, and management of initiatives similar to _The Unjournal._

We are continually looking to enrich our general team and board, including our [#management-committee-members](../../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities/#management-committee-members "mention"), [#advisory-board-members-abm-and-field-specialists-fs](../../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities/#advisory-board-members-abm-and-field-specialists-fs "mention") These roles come with some compensation and incentives.
