# Advisory/team roles (research, management)

In addition to the 'work roles' we are looking to engage researchers, research users, meta-scientists, and people with experience in open science, open access, and management of initiatives similar to The Unjournal.

We are continually looking to enrich our general team and board, including our [#management-committee-members](../../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities.md#management-committee-members "mention"), [#advisory-board-members-abm-and-field-specialists-fs](../../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities.md#advisory-board-members-abm-and-field-specialists-fs "mention").&#x20;
