# Administration, operations and management roles

These are principally not research roles, but familiarity with research and research environments will be helpful, and there is room for research involvement, depending on the candidate’s interest, background, and skills/aptitudes.&#x20;

There are currently two such roles:

   * Help us build flexible communications templates for working with research evaluators, authors, and others
4. Other communications, presentations, and dissemination
   * Write and organize content for grants applications, partnership requests, advertising, hiring, and more
   * Potentially: compose non-technical write-ups of Unjournal evaluation synthesis content (in line with interest and ability)

* Willingness to learn and use IT, project management, data management, web design, and text-parsing tools (such as those mentioned below), with the aid of GPT/AI chat

**Further desirable skills and experience:**

* Academic/research background in areas related to The Unjournal’s work
* Operations, administrative, and project management experience
* Experience working in a small nonprofit institution

**Proposed terms:**

* Project-based contract ‘freelance’ work
* $30-$55/hour USD (TBD, depending on experience and capabilities). Hours for each project include some onboarding and upskilling time.
* Our current budget can cover roughly 200 hours of this project work. We hope to increase and extend this (depending on our future funding and expenses).
