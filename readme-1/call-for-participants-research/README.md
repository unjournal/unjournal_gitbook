# How to get involved

## **In brief**

[The Unjournal](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/-MkORcaM5xGxmrnczq25/)  (see our [#in-a-nutshell](../#in-a-nutshell "mention")) wants your involvement, help, and feedback. We offer recognize and compensate people for their time and effort.&#x20;

1. _**Read our evaluation packages**_ [**here**](https://unjournal.pubpub.org), add comments, [cite the evaluations in your work](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], let us know how you found them useful and how we can improve.
2. _**Make Unjournal evaluations part of your process,**_ using them to consider your funding and policy choices, encouraging your team or department to submit work for public evaluation, and make this part of your hiring, promotion, and research funding criteria.&#x20;
3. _**Submit your research**_ for Unjournal to evaluate [here](https://bit.ly/UJsubmit), or by contacting [contact@unjournal.org](https://app.gitbook.com/u/Kb2a1KdsgsTOM7ZYPPCIyGkho3Q2). **Suggest research** for us to assess using [this form](https://bit.ly/UJsuggest). &#x20;
4. _**Join our team:**  Complete_ [_this form_](https://bit.ly/ujteam) [_(about 3–5 min)_](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] _to apply for our..._
   1. **Evaluator pool**: to be eligible to be commissioned and paid to evaluate and rate research, mainly in quantitative social science and policy
   2. **Field specialist teams**: help identify, prioritize, and manage research evaluation in a particular field or cause area. A related lower-commitment role: [#unjournal-research-affiliates-ura](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities/#unjournal-research-affiliates-ura "mention")  help suggest, prioritize, and discuss research
   3. **Management team** or **advisory board**, to be part of our decision-making
5. _**Do an Independent Evaluation**_ to build your portfolio, receive guidance, and be eligible for promotion and prizes. See details [independent-evaluations-trial](independent-evaluations-trial/ "mention")
6. &#x20;**Suggest** [pivotal-questions](../../pivotal-questions/ "mention") for us to focus on



_**Give us feedback:** What did you find useful and how did you use the work?  Is anything unclear? What could be improved?_ Email contact@unjournal.org, and we will respond. We will offer rewards for the most useful suggestions.



## Overview and call

[David Reinstein](https://www.davidreinstein.org/) is the founder and co-director[^3] of _The Unjournal_. The organization is currently looking for field specialists and evaluators, as well as suggestions for relevant work for _The Unjournal_ to evaluate.

_The Unjournal_ [team](https://www.unjournal.org/team) is building a system for credible, public, journal-independent feedback and evaluation of research.

<details>

<summary><em>Briefly,</em> The Unjournal<em>’s basic process is:</em></summary>

* Identify, invite, or select contributions of relevant research _that_ [_is publicly hosted_](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] on any open platform or archive in any format.
* Pay evaluators to give careful feedback on this work, with prizes and incentives for strong evaluation work.
* Elicit quantifiable and comparable metrics of research quality as credible measures of value (see: [evaluator guidelines](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/)). Synthesize the results of these evaluations in useful ways.
* Publicly post and link all reviews of the work. Award financial prizes for the work judged strongest.
* Allow _evaluators_ to choose if they wish to remain anonymous or to "sign" their reviews.
* Aim to be as transparent as possible in these processes.

</details>

We maintain an **open call for participants** for several different roles:

1. [**Management Committee members**](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities/#management-committee-members) (involving honorariums for time spent)
2. [**Advisory Board**](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities/#advisory-board-members-abm) members (no time commitment)
3. [**Field Specialists**](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities/#field-specialists-fs) (who will often also be on the Advisory Board)
4. [**Unjournal Research Affiliates**](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities/#unjournal-research-affiliates-specifics-and-norms) (low commitment)&#x20;
5. A pool of **Evaluators** (who will be paid for their time and their work; we also draw evaluators from outside this pool)

[The roles are explained in more detail here.](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities/) You can express your interest (and enter our database) [here](https://bit.ly/ujteam).

<details>

<summary>Some particular research area/field priorities (Sept. 2024)</summary>

We're interested in researchers and research-users who want to help us prioritize work for evaluation, and manage evaluations, considering

... research in any social science/economics/policy/impact-assessment area, and

... research with the potential to be among the most globally-impactful.



Some particular areas where we are hoping to expand our expertise (as of Sept. 2024) include:

\- Biological & pandemic risk&#x20;

\- AI governance, AI safety&#x20;

\- Long-term trends, demography

\- Macroeconomics/growth/(public) finance

\- Quantitative political science (voting, lobbying, etc.)

\- Social impact of new technology (including AI)

</details>

## **Evaluators**

We will reach out to evaluators (a.k.a. "reviewers") on a case-by-case basis, appropriate for each paper or project being assessed. This is dependent on expertise, the researcher's interest, and a lack of conflict of interest.&#x20;

**Time commitment**: Case-by-case basis. For each evaluation, [here are some guidelines](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/#length-and-time-possible-benchmarks) for the amount of time to spend.

**Compensation**: We pay evaluators for their time and effort, targeting an average of $350 per evaluation including prizes and incentives (and aim to return to $450+ with future funding). [See here for more details](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/for-prospective-evaluators.md).

**Who we are looking for:** We are putting together a list of people interested in being an evaluator and doing paid referee work for _The Unjournal_. We generally prioritize the pool of evaluators who signed up for our database before reaching out more widely.

_Interested? Please fill out_ [_this form_ ](https://coda.io/form/Join-the-Unjournal_dc3NLlpa-eq)_(about 3–5 min, same form for all roles or involvement)._

&#x20;_**Ready to get started doing evaluations and building a track record?**_ See our new  [independent-evaluations-trial](independent-evaluations-trial/ "mention") initiative, offering prizes and recognition for the best work. You can evaluate work in our [public database](https://coda.io/d/Public-Database-of-Research_d7VdSLeCrpi/Unjournal-Research-with-potential-for-impact-database_suCwXMPL#_luqRnzt6), or suggest and evaluate work.
{% endhint %}



## **Projects and papers**

We are looking for high-quality, globally pivotal research projects to evaluate, particularly those embodying open science practices and innovative formats. We are putting out a call for relevant research. Please suggest research [here](https://airtable.com/applDG6ifmUmeEJ7j/shrAsvmrx05PDHfdw). (We offer bounties and prizes for useful suggestions – [see note](#user-content-fn-5)[^5].) For details of what we are looking for, and some potential examples, [see this post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see) and accompanying links.

You can also put [forward your own work](https://coda.io/form/Suggesting-research_ddYqto0PuD0).
