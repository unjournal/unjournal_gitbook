## Overview and call

I am [David Reinstein](https://www.davidreinstein.org/), founder and co-director[^1] of The Unjournal. We have an open call for committee members, board members, reviewers, and suggestions for relevant work for The Unjournal to evaluate.

The [Unjournal team](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/master/discussion-team/who-are-we-our-team) is building a system for credible, public, journal-independent feedback and evaluation of research.

<details>

<summary><em>Briefly, The Unjournalâ€™s process (summarized again) is:</em></summary>

* Identify, invite, or select contributions of relevant research _that_ [_is publicly hosted_](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] on any open platform or archive in any format.
* Pay evaluators to give careful feedback on this work, with prizes and incentives for strong evaluation work.
* Elicit quantifiable and comparable metrics of research quality as credible measures of value (see: [evaluator guidelines](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/)). Synthesize the results of these evaluations in useful ways.
* Publicly post and link all reviews of the work. Award financial prizes for the work judged strongest.
* Allow _evaluators_ to choose if they wish to remain anonymous or to 'sign their reviews.'
* Aim to be as transparent as possible in these processes.

</details>

We maintain an **open call for participants** for 4 different roles:

1. [**Management committee members**](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities.md#management-committee-members) (involving honorariums for time spent)
2. [**Advisory board**](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities.md#advisory-board-members-abm) members (no time commitment)
3. [**Field Specialists**](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities.md#field-specialists-fs) (who will often also be on the Advisory Board)
4. A pool of **Evaluators** (who will be paid for their time and their work; we also draw evaluators from outside this pool).

[The roles are explained in more detail HERE.](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities.md) You can express your interest (and enter our database) [here](https://airtable.com/shrtMv4hNlv8aL7Yy).

<details>

<summary>Some particular research area/field priorities (15 Aug 2023)</summary>

We're interested in researchers and research-users who want to help us prioritize work for evaluation, and manage evaluations, considering

... research in any social science/economics/policy/impact-assessment area

... research with the potential to be among the most globally-impactful.

\


Some particular areas that we are hoping to expand our expertise (as of  15 Aug 2023)include:

\- Biological & pandemic risk&#x20;

\- AI governance, AI safety&#x20;

\- Animal welfare, markets for animal products&#x20;

\- Long-term trends, demography

\- Macroeconomics/growth/(public) finance

\- Quantitative political science (voting, lobbying, etc.)

\- Social impact of new technology (including AI)

</details>





## **Evaluators**

We will reach out to evaluators (aka 'reviewers') on a case-by-case basis, appropriate for each paper or project being assessed. This is dependent on expertise, the researchers' interest, and a lack of conflict of interest. .

**Time commitment**: Case-by-case basis. For each evaluation, [here are some guidelines](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/#length-and-time-possible-benchmarks) for the amount of time to spend.

**Compensation**: We pay a minimum of $400 (updated July 2023) per on-time and complete evaluation, and offer additional prizes and incentives. See [here](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/) for more details.

**Who we are looking for:** We are putting together a list of people interested in being an evaluator and doing paid referee work for the Unjournal. We generally prioritize the pool of evaluators who signed up for our database before reaching out more widely.

_Interested? Please fill out_ [_this form_](https://airtable.com/shrtMv4hNlv8aL7Yy) _(about 3-5 min, same form for all roles/involvement)._

## **Projects and papers**

We are looking for high-quality, globally-pivotal research projects to evaluate, particularly those embodying open science practices and innovative formats. We are putting out a call for relevant research. Please suggest research [here](https://airtable.com/shrdHHI0zK7rkJCP3). (We offer bounties and prizes for useful suggestions - [see note](#user-content-fn-3)[^3].) For details of what we are looking for, and some potential examples, [see this post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see), and accompanying links.

You can also [put forward your own work here](https://airtable.com/shrwlxes5AeasnkfC).

We provide a separate form for research suggestions [here](https://airtable.com/shrdHHI0zK7rkJCP3). We may follow up with you individually.
