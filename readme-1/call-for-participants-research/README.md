# How to get involved

See [#in-a-nutshell](../#in-a-nutshell "mention") for an overview of _The Unjournal._

{% hint style="info" %}
**In brief (TLDR):**\
If you are interested in being on _The_ _Unjournal_'s management committee, advisory board, or evaluator pool, please fill out [this form](https://bit.ly/ujteam) (about 3–5 min). &#x20;

If you want to suggest research for us to assess, please fill out [this form](https://bit.ly/UJsuggest). You can also submit your _own_ work [here](https://bit.ly/UJsubmit), or by contacting [contact@unjournal.org](https://app.gitbook.com/u/Kb2a1KdsgsTOM7ZYPPCIyGkho3Q2).

## Overview and call

I am [David Reinstein](https://www.davidreinstein.org/), founder and co-director[^1] of _The Unjournal_. We have an open call for committee members, board members, reviewers, and suggestions for relevant work for _The Unjournal_ to evaluate.

_The_ [_Unjournal_ team](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/readme-1/discussion-team) is building a system for credible, public, journal-independent feedback and evaluation of research.

<details>

<summary><em>Briefly,</em> The Unjournal<em>’s basic process is:</em></summary>

* Identify, invite, or select contributions of relevant research _that_ [_is publicly hosted_](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] on any open platform or archive in any format.
* Pay evaluators to give careful feedback on this work, with prizes and incentives for strong evaluation work.
* Elicit quantifiable and comparable metrics of research quality as credible measures of value (see: [evaluator guidelines](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/)). Synthesize the results of these evaluations in useful ways.
* Publicly post and link all reviews of the work. Award financial prizes for the work judged strongest.
* Allow _evaluators_ to choose if they wish to remain anonymous or to "sign" their reviews.
* Aim to be as transparent as possible in these processes.

</details>

We maintain an **open call for participants** for four different roles:

1. [**Management Committee members**](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities/#management-committee-members) (involving honorariums for time spent)
2. [**Advisory Board**](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities/#advisory-board-members-abm) members (no time commitment)
3. [**Field Specialists**](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities/#field-specialists-fs) (who will often also be on the Advisory Board)
4. A pool of **Evaluators** (who will be paid for their time and their work; we also draw evaluators from outside this pool)

[The roles are explained in more detail here.](../organizational-roles-and-responsibilities/) You can express your interest (and enter our database) [here](https://bit.ly/ujteam).

<details>

<summary>Some particular research area/field priorities (Sept. 2024)</summary>

We're interested in researchers and research-users who want to help us prioritize work for evaluation, and manage evaluations, considering

... research in any social science/economics/policy/impact-assessment area, and

... research with the potential to be among the most globally-impactful.



Some particular areas where we are hoping to expand our expertise (as of  15 Aug 2023) include:

\- Biological & pandemic risk&#x20;

\- AI governance, AI safety&#x20;

\- Long-term trends, demography

\- Macroeconomics/growth/(public) finance

\- Quantitative political science (voting, lobbying, etc.)

\- Social impact of new technology (including AI)

</details>

## **Evaluators**

We will reach out to evaluators (a.k.a. "reviewers") on a case-by-case basis, appropriate for each paper or project being assessed. This is dependent on expertise, the researcher's interest, and a lack of conflict of interest.&#x20;

**Time commitment**: Case-by-case basis. For each evaluation, [here are some guidelines](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/#length-and-time-possible-benchmarks) for the amount of time to spend.

**Compensation**: We pay a minimum of $200 (updated Aug. 2024) for a prompt and complete evaluation, $400 for _experienced_ evaluators. We offer additional prizes and incentives, and are committed to an average compensation of at least $450 per evaluator.  [See here for more details](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/for-prospective-evaluators.md).

**Who we are looking for:** We are putting together a list of people interested in being an evaluator and doing paid referee work for _The Unjournal_. We generally prioritize the pool of evaluators who signed up for our database before reaching out more widely.

_Interested? Please fill out_ [_this form_](https://airtable.com/shrtMv4hNlv8aL7Yy) _(about 3–5 min, same form for all roles or involvement)._



{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;_**Ready to get started doing evaluations and building a track record?**_ See our new  [independent-evaluations-trial.md](independent-evaluations-trial.md "mention") initiative, offering prizes and recognition for the best work. You can evaluate work in our [public database](https://coda.io/d/Public-Database-of-Research\_d7VdSLeCrpi/Unjournal-Research-with-potential-for-impact-database\_suCwXMPL#\_luqRnzt6), or suggest and evaluate work.
{% endhint %}



## **Projects and papers**

We are looking for high-quality, globally pivotal research projects to evaluate, particularly those embodying open science practices and innovative formats. We are putting out a call for relevant research. Please suggest research [here](https://airtable.com/applDG6ifmUmeEJ7j/shrAsvmrx05PDHfdw). (We offer bounties and prizes for useful suggestions – [see note](#user-content-fn-3)[^3].) For details of what we are looking for, and some potential examples, [see this post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see) and accompanying links.

You can also [put forward your own work](https://airtable.com/applDG6ifmUmeEJ7j/shrcN2cwsXpmnkOL1).

We provide a separate form for research suggestions[ here](https://airtable.com/applDG6ifmUmeEJ7j/shrAsvmrx05PDHfdw). We may follow up with you individually.

## Contact us

If you are interested in discussing any of the above in person, please email us ([contact@unjournal.org](https://app.gitbook.com/u/Kb2a1KdsgsTOM7ZYPPCIyGkho3Q2)) to arrange a conversation.
