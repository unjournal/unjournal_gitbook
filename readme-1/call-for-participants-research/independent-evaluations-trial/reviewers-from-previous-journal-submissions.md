# Reviewers from previous journal submissions

Did you just write a brilliant peer review for an economics (or social science, policy etc.) journal? Your work should not be wasted, there should be a way to share your insights and get credit.&#x20;

Consider transforming these insights into a public "[independent evaluation](./)" for [The Unjournal](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/-MkORcaM5xGxmrnczq25/). This will benefit the community and help make research better and more impactful. And we can share your work. provide you feedback, and build a portfolio with The Unjournal, making it more likely we will hire you for paid work and compensate you at the higher rate. And we offer prizes for the best work.&#x20;

You can do this either anonymously or sign your name.

Here's the fancy way of saying this (thanks Claude.ai):

> Journal peer review is critical for assessing and improving research, but too often these valuable discussions remain hidden behind closed doors. By publishing a version of your review, you can:  (1) Amplify the impact of your reviewing efforts by contextualizing the research for a broader audience, (2)  Facilitate more transparent academic discussions around the strengths and limitations of the work, (3) Get public recognition for your peer review contributions, which are often unseen and unrewarded (4) Reduce overall reviewing burdens by allowing your assessment to be reused, (5) Support a culture of open scholarship by modeling constructive feedback on public research

## Considerations

### Permission and journals' constraints

Many journals explicitly allow reviewers to publish the content of their reviews, with some important caveats. The [Publish Your Reviews initiative](https://freeourknowledge.org/2022-07-17-publish-your-reviews/) gathered public statements from several journals and publishers confirming that they support reviewers posting their comments externally. However, they generally ask reviewers to remove any confidential information before sharing their reviews. This includes: the name of the journal,  the publication recommendation (e.g., accept, revise, or reject), and any other details the journal or authors considered confidential, such as unpublished data

For these journals, we are happy to accept and share/link the verbatim content as part of an independent Unjournal evaluation.&#x20;

But even for journals that have not signed onto this, _you are still absolutely entitled to share your own expert opinions on publicly-shared research._ In these cases we suggest you don't share verbatim content from your review, as well, as not mentioning any of the details noted above.&#x20;

_Even if a journal considers the specific review submitted to them confidential, this doesn't prevent the reviewer from expressing their independent assessment elsewhere._
