# Organizational roles and responsibilities

{% hint style="info" %}
5 Sep 2024: The Unjournal is still looking to build our team and evaluator pool. Please consider the roles below and [express your interest here](https://coda.io/form/Join-the-Unjournal_dc3NLlpa-eq) or contact us at contact@unjournal.org.
{% endhint %}

## **Management committee members**

Activities of those on the management committee may involve a combination of the following (although you can choose your focus):

* Contributing to the decision-making process regarding research focus, reviewer assignment, and prize distribution.
* Collaborating with other committee members on the establishment of rules and guidelines, such as determining the metrics for research evaluation and defining the mode of assessment publication.
* Helping plan _The Unjournal_’s future path.
* Helping monitor and prioritize research for _The Unjournal_ to evaluate (i.e., acting as a [field specialist](./#field-specialists-fs); see further discussion below). Acting as an [evaluation manager](../../management-tech-details-discussion/management-process/) for research in your area.

**Time commitment**: A minimum of 15–20 hours per year.

**Compensation**: We have funding for a $57.50 per hour honorarium for the first 20 hours, with possible compensation [for additional work](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. [Evaluation management work](../../management-tech-details-discussion/management-process/) will be further compensated (at roughly $300–$450 per paper).

**Who we are looking for**: All applicants are welcome. We are especially interested in those involved in global priorities research (and related fields), policy research and practice, open science and meta-science, bibliometrics and scholarly publishing, and any other academic research. We want individuals with a solid interest in _The Unjournal_ project and its goals, and the ability to meet the minimal time commitment. Applying is extremely quick, and those not chosen will be considered for other roles and work going forward.

## **Advisory board (AB) members**&#x20;

Beyond direct roles within _The Unjournal_, we're building a larger, more passive advisory board to be part of our network, to offer occasional feedback and guidance. There is essentially no minimum time commitment for advisory board members—only opportunities to engage.  We sketch some of the expectations in the fold below.

<details>

<summary>Advisory board members: expectations (sketch: Aug. 15, 2023)</summary>

_As an AB member..._

* you agree to be listed on our page as being on the advisory board.
* you have the option (but not the expectation or requirement) to join our Slack, and to check in once in a while.
* you will be looped in for your input on some decisions surrounding _The Unjournal_'s policies and direction. Such communications might occur once per month, and you are not obligated to respond.&#x20;
* you may be invited to occasional video meetings (again optional).
* you are “in our system” and we may consult you for other work.&#x20;
* you will be compensated for anything that requires a substantial amount of your time that does not overlap with your regular work.

## **Field specialists (FS), Unjournal Research Affiliates (URA)**

{% hint style="info" %}
Dec 2024: We're introducing a lower-commitment "Unjournal Research Affiliate" role, targeted at PhD students, but available more broadly. See below.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

FSs will focus on a particular area of research, policy, or impactful outcome. They will keep track of new or under-considered research with potential for impact and explain and assess the extent to which _The Unjournal_ can add value by commissioning its evaluation. They will "curate" this research and may also serve as evaluation managers for this work.

**Time commitment**: There is no specific time obligation—only opportunities to engage. We may also consult you occasionally on your areas of expertise. Perhaps 1–4 hours a month is a reasonable starting expectation for people already involved in doing or using research, plus potential additional paid assignments.

Our [Incentives and norms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aGVf9Hq6PRVy1dYFVvLw47Mg96ZMWKbq3G3wbQdD9ZE/edit) document also provides some guidance on the nature of work and the time involved.

**Compensation:** We have put together a preliminary/trial compensation formula ([incentives and norms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aGVf9Hq6PRVy1dYFVvLw47Mg96ZMWKbq3G3wbQdD9ZE/edit)); we aim to fairly compensate people for time spent on work done to support _The Unjournal_, and to provide incentives for suggesting and helping to prioritize research for evaluation. In addition, [evaluation management work](../../management-tech-details-discussion/management-process/) will be compensated at roughly $300–$450 per project.

**Who we are looking for**: For the FS roles, we are seeking active researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders with a strong publication record and/or involvement in the research and/or research-linked policy and prioritization processes. For the AB, also people with connections to academic, governmental, or relevant non-profit institutions, and/or involvement in open science, publication, and research evaluation processes. People who can offer relevant advice, experience, guidance, or help communicate our goals, processes, and progress.

_Interested?_ [_Please fill out_ _this form_](https://coda.io/form/Join-the-Unjournal_dc3NLlpa-eq) _(about 3–5 min, using the same form for all roles)._

<details>

<summary><em>If you become a field specialist, what happens next?</em></summary>

You will be asked to fill out  to let us know what fields, topics, and sources of research you would like to "monitor" or dig into to help identify and curate work relevant for _Unjournal_ evaluation, as well as outlining your areas of expertise (the form takes perhaps 5–20 minutes).

This survey helps us understand when to contact you to ask if you want to be an evaluation manager on a paper we have prioritized for evaluation.

Guided by this survey form (along with discussions we will have with you, and coordination with the team), we will develop an “assignment” that specifies the area you will cover. We will try to divide the space and not overlap between field specialists. This scope can be as broad or focused as you like.&#x20;

Within your area, you keep a record of the research that seems relevant (and why, and what particularly needs evaluation, etc.) and enter it in our database. (Alternatively, you can pass your notes to us for recording.)

We will compensate you for the time you spend on this process (details tbd), particularly to the extent that the time you spend does not contribute to your other work or research. (See [incentives and norms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aGVf9Hq6PRVy1dYFVvLw47Mg96ZMWKbq3G3wbQdD9ZE/edit) [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aGVf9Hq6PRVy1dYFVvLw47Mg96ZMWKbq3G3wbQdD9ZE/edit).)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Field specialist "area teams" </summary>

We are organizing several teams of field specialists (and management and advisory board members). These teams will hold occasional online meetings (perhaps every 3 months) to discuss research to prioritize, and to help coordinate 'who covers what'. If team members are interested, further discussions, meetings, and seminars might be arranged, but this is very much optional.&#x20;

As of Dec 2024, we have  the following teams (organized around fields and outcomes)

1. Development economics and global health and development
2. Economics, welfare, and governance&#x20;
3. Psychology, behavioral science, and attitudes&#x20;
4. Innovation and meta-science, impact of emerging technologies, catastrophic risks
5. Animal welfare: markets, attitudes
6. Environmental economics&#x20;

Other teams are being organized or considered

</details>

<details>

<summary>"Monitoring" a research area or source as a field specialist</summary>

_The Unjournal'_&#x73; field specialists choose an area they want to monitor. By this we mean that a field specialist will

* Keep an eye on designated sources (e.g., particular working paper series) and fields (or outcomes or area codes), perhaps every month or so; consider new work, dig into archives&#x20;
* Let us know what you have been able to cover; if you need to reduce the scope, we can adjust it
* Suggest/Input work into our database … papers/projects/research that seems relevant for _The Unjournal_ to evaluate. Give  some quick ‘prioritization ratings’&#x20;
* If you have time, give a brief on why this work relevant for _UJ_ (impactful, credible, timely, open presentation, policy-relevant, etc) and what areas need particular evaluation and feedback

</details>

### Unjournal Research Affiliates (URA)

PhD students (and others) may be interested in getting involved but worried about making commitments[^2].  But getting busy students and researchers involved even minimally could keep us in touch with the cutting edge of research and help us forge collaborations in academia. So we're offering the [“Unjournal Research Affiliate”](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] role, which is  similar to the Field Specialists, but with less responsibility and time commitment.  It comes with [no baseline compensation](#user-content-fn-4)[^4], but URAs are eligible for the compensation for suggesting papers, high-value assessment prioritization, etc.

#### Unjournal Research Affiliates will be expected to

1. Join our Slack and Coda, but there is no expectation to check in regularly.
2. Suggest 2-3 papers per term (Spring, Summer, Autumn), and explain why these have potential for impact. This comes with modest compensation; see above.
3. Give the 2nd opinion (assessment) for 3 papers per term.
4. Vote on 5-10 papers per term; check in to vote 1x per month or more
5. Understand and be able to explain The Unjournal to your colleagues/on social media
6. Join at least one (one hour) FS or Unjournal general meeting per year.

Evaluation management is not expected, but we may may consult URAs for occasional help in suggesting evaluators, with potential compensation.



## Contact us

If you are interested in discussing any of the above in person, please email us ([contact@unjournal.org](https://app.gitbook.com/u/Kb2a1KdsgsTOM7ZYPPCIyGkho3Q2)) to arrange a conversation.

We invite you to [fill in this form](https://coda.io/form/Join-the-Unjournal_dc3NLlpa-eq) (the same as that linked above) to leave your contact information and outline which parts of the project interest you.

_Note_: These descriptions are under continual refinement; see our [policies](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/) for more details.

[^1]: Our current budget covers an average of roughly 80 total hours per Management Committee member at this rate.

[^2]: They are super-busy, especially in the first years, and the program will generally discourage them from any ‘distractions’.

[^3]: To avoid complication, we will list these as 'Field Specialists', potentially with an asterisk for clarification.&#x20;

[^4]: We may apply for grants to fund some compensation for this in the future.
