## March 25 2024: Workshop: Innovations in Research Evaluation, Replicability, and Impact

> Research evaluation is changing: New approaches go beyond the traditional journal model, promoting transparency, replicability, open science, open access, and global impact. You can be a part of this.

Join us on March 25 for an interactive workshop, featuring presentations from Macie Daley (Center for Open Science), [David Reinstein](http://davidreinstein.org) (The Unjournal), [Gary Charness](https://faculty.econ.ucsb.edu/~charness/) (UC Santa Barbara), and The Unjournal's Impactful Research Prize and Evaluator Prize winners.

See the [event page here](https://bit.ly/UJevent) for all details.
