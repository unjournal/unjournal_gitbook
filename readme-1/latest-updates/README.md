# Latest updates

Our 'Pilot Phase', involving ten papers and roughly 20 evaluations is almost complete. We just released the evaluation package for ["The Governance Of Non-Profits And Their Social Impact: Evidence From A Randomized Program In Healthcare In DRC](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/eval-sum-governance-nonprofits/release/3)‚Äù. We are now waiting on one last evaluation, followed by author responses and 'publishing' the final two packages at [https://unjournal.pubpub.org/](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/). (Remember: we publish the evaluations, responses and synthesis; we _link_ the research being evaluated.)

We will make decisions and award our [Impactful Research Prize](../call-for-participants-research/impactful-research-prize/) (and possible seminars) and evaluator prizes soon after. The winners will be determined by a consensus of our management team and advisory board (potentially consulting external expertise). The choices will be largely driven by the ratings and predictions given by _Unjournal_ evaluators. After we make the choices, we will make our decision process public and transparent.

We continue to develop processes and policies around "which research to prioritize." For example, we are considering whether we should set targets for different fields, for related outcome "cause categories," and for research sources. This discussion continues among our team and with stakeholders. We intend to open up the discussion further, making it public and bringing in a range of voices. The objective is to develop a framework and a systematic process to make these decisions. See our expanding notes and discussion on [What is global-priorities relevant research?](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/b1RpEkRWWqZAV4SlrFCt/the-field-and-ea-gp-research)

We want to keep the community informed of our progress and the steps we are considering next. We want your feedback too! Below, we summarize what _The Unjournal_ has been up to.
