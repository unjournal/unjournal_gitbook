<summary>Update: 21 July 2023</summary>

### Funding

The SFF grant is now 'in our account'. This makes it possible for us to move forward in filling staff and contractor positions and increase evaluator compensation and incentives/rewards.

### Timelines, and pipelines

Our "Pilot Phase," involving ten papers and roughly 20 evaluations, is almost complete.

### Call for "Field Specialists"

We partitioned research monitoring amongst "Field Specialists" who focus on particular areas of research, policy, or impactful outcomes.

### Increase in evaluator compensation

We increased the base compensation for evaluations to $400, and set aside $150 per evaluation for incentives, rewards, and prizes.

### New Advisory Board members

* Gary Charness, Professor of Economics, UC Santa Barbara
* Nicolas Treich, Associate Researcher, INRAE, Toulouse School of Economics
* Anca Hanea, Associate Professor, University of Melbourne
* Jordan Dworkin, Program Lead, Impetus Institute for Meta-science
