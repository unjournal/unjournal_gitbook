# Why Unjournal?

The features of The Unjournal, and what the project offers beyond the traditional academic publication methods.&#x20;

See sections below:

[costs-of-playing-the-publication-game.md](costs-of-playing-the-publication-game.md "mention"): Shows how The Unjournal's process reduces the traditionally high costs and 'games' associated with standard publication mechanisms.

[promoting-open-robust-science.md](promoting-open-robust-science.md "mention"): The Unjournal promotes research replicability/robustness in line with the RRC agenda.

[global-priorities-theory-of-change.md](global-priorities-theory-of-change.md "mention"): The Unjournal aims to enhance research reliability, accessibility, and usefulness through a robust evaluation system, fostering a productive bridge between mainstream and EA-focused researchers.

* [aside-open-access-and-information-hazards.md](global-priorities-theory-of-change/aside-open-access-and-information-hazards.md "mention"): Addresses possible information hazards in open research.

[more-reliable-and-useful-evaluation](more-reliable-and-useful-evaluation/ "mention"): The Unjournal's open evaluation model expedites and enhances research reviews by providing transparent, incentivized feedback and valuable, public metrics.

* [multiple-dimensions-of-meaningful-feedback.md](multiple-dimensions-of-meaningful-feedback.md "mention"): Discusses our method of obtaining separate evaluations on various aspects of a research project—methodological, theoretical, and applied—from diverse expert groups, which leads to more comprehensive and insightful feedback.

[dynamic-documents-vs-living-projects.md](dynamic-documents-vs-living-projects.md "mention"): Explains the terms 'dynamic documents' and 'living projects' in relation to our model, and how they facilitate continuous growth in research projects.

* [benefits-of-dynamic-documents.md](benefits-of-dynamic-documents.md "mention"): Why open dynamic documents (such as [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org)) are better for research than 'PDF prisons', the conventional static PDF format that dominates research.
* [living-research-projects.md](living-research-projects.md "mention"): Details these 'living projects' and how, under our approach, they can continuously evolve, receive evaluations, and undergo improvements within the same environment.
