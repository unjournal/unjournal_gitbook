# Why Unjournal?

_What do we offer? How does it improve upon traditional academic review/publishing?_&#x20;

[costs-of-playing-the-publication-game.md](costs-of-playing-the-publication-game.md "mention"): The Unjournal's process reduces the high costs and "gaming" associated with standard journal publication mechanisms.

[promoting-open-robust-science.md](promoting-open-robust-science.md "mention"): We promote research replicability and robustness in line with the RRC agenda.

[global-priorities-theory-of-change](global-priorities-theory-of-change/ "mention"): We prioritize impactful work. Expert evaluators focus on reliability, robustness, and usefulness. This fosters a productive bridge between high-profile mainstream researchers and global-impact-focused organizations, researchers, and practitioners.

[more-reliable-and-useful-evaluation](more-reliable-and-useful-evaluation/ "mention"): We open up the evaluation process, making it more timely and transparent, and providing valuable public metrics and feedback for the benefit of authors, other researchers, and policymakers who may want to _use_ the research..

[dynamic-documents-vs-living-projects](dynamic-documents-vs-living-projects/ "mention"): By separating evaluation from journal publication, free research from the static 'PDF prisons'. This enables "dynamic documents/notebooks" that boost transparency and replicability, improved research communication through web-based formats. It also facilitates "living projects": research that can continuously grow, improving in response to feedback and incorporating new data and methods in the same environment.&#x20;
