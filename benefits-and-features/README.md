See sections below:

[costs-of-playing-the-publication-game.md](costs-of-playing-the-publication-game.md "mention"): Shows how The Unjournal's process reduces the traditionally high costs and 'games' associated with standard publication mechanisms.

[dynamic-documents-vs-living-projects.md](dynamic-documents-vs-living-projects.md "mention"): Explains the terms 'dynamic documents' and 'living projects' in relation to our model, and how they facilitate continuous growth in research projects.

[benefits-of-dynamic-documents.md](benefits-of-dynamic-documents.md "mention"): Why open dynamic documents (such as [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org)) are better for research than 'PDF prisons', the conventional static PDF format that dominates research.

[living-research-projects.md](living-research-projects.md "mention"): Details these 'living projects' and how, under our approach, they can continuously evolve, receive evaluations, and undergo improvements within the same environment

[multiple-dimensions-of-meaningful-feedback.md](multiple-dimensions-of-meaningful-feedback.md "mention"): Discusses our method of obtaining separate evaluations on various aspects of a research project—methodological, theoretical, and applied—from diverse expert groups, which leads to more comprehensive and insightful feedback.
