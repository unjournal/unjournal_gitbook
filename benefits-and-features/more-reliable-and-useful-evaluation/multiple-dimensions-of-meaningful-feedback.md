# Multiple dimensions of feedback

**Journal-independent review allows work to be rated separately in different areas**: theoretical rigor and innovation, empirical methods, policy relevance, and so on, with separate ratings in each category by experts in that area.\
\
As a researcher in the current system, I cannot both submit my paper and get public evaluation from (for example) JET and the Journal of Development Economics for a paper engaging both areas.

**The Unjournal, **_**and journal-independent evaluation, can enable this through**_

* commissioning a range of evaluators with expertise in distinct areas, and making this expertise known in the public evaluations;
* asking specifically for multiple dimensions of quantitative (and descriptive) feedback and ratings (see especially [#metrics-overall-assessment-categories](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/#metrics-overall-assessment-categories "mention") under our [guidelines-for-evaluators](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/ "mention")); and
* allowing authors to gain evaluation in particular areas _in addition_ to the implicit value of publication in specific traditional field journals.
