# Benefits of Dynamic Documents

'Dynamic Documents' are projects or papers that are developed using prominent tools such as R-markdown or JuPyTer notebooks (the two most prominent tools).

The salient features and benefits of this approach include:

* **Integrated data analysis and reporting** means the data analysis (as well as math/simulations) is done and reported in the same space that the results and discussion are presented. This is made possible through the concealment of 'code blocks'.
* **Transparent reporting** means you can track exactly what is being reported and how it was constructed:
  * Making the process a lot less error-prone
  * Helping readers understand it better (see ['explorable explanations'](http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/))
  * Helping replicators and future researchers build on it
* Other advantages of these formats (over PDFs for example) include:
  * Convenient ‘folding blocks’
  * Margin comments
  * [Hoverable notes](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] and links
  * Integrating interactive tools
