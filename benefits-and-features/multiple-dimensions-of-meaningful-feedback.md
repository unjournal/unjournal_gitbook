# Multiple dimensions of feedback

**Journal independent review allows work to be separately rated in different areas**â€¦ theoretical rigor and innovation, empirical methods, policy relevance etc, with separate ratings in each category by experts in that area.\
\
In the current system, I cannot both submit my paper and get public evaluation from (e.g.) JET and the Journal of Development Economics (for a paper engaging both areas).

__

_**The Unjournal, and journal-independent evaluation can enable this through**_

* Commissioning a range of evaluators with expertise in distinct areas, and making this expertise  known in the public evaluations
* Specifically asking for multiple dimensions of quantitative (and descriptive) feedback and rating   (see especially [#metrics-overall-assessment-categories](../our-policies-evaluation-and-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/#metrics-overall-assessment-categories "mention") under our [guidelines-for-evaluators](../our-policies-evaluation-and-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/ "mention"))
* Allowing authors to gain evaluation in particular areas _in addition_ to the implicit value of publication in specific traditional field journals&#x20;
