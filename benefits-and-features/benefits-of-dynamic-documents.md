# Benefits of 'dynamic docs'

**“Dynamic Documents”** I mean papers/projects built with R-markdown or JuPyTer notebooks (the two most prominent tools) that

* _do and report the data analysis_ (as well as math/simulations) in the same space that the results and discussion are presented (with ‘code blocks’ hidden)
* a key benefit is you can track exactly what is being reported and how it was constructed;
  * this makes it a lot less error-prone
  * and helps readers understand it better (see ['explorable explanations'](http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/))
  * and helps replicators and future researchers build on it
* other advantages of these formats (over, e.g., pdf) include convenient ‘folding blocks’, margin comments, and integrating interactive tools
*

* see corrigendum in journals Reinhart and Rogoff error?
* open science MOOC in R markdown ...
* OSF and all of their training/promo materials in OS
