# Balancing information accessibility and hazard concerns

We acknowledge the potential for "information hazards" when research methods, tools, and results become more accessible. This is of particular concern in the context of direct physical and biological science research, particularly in [biosecurity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9009689/) (although there is a case that specific [open science practices may be beneficial](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001600)). ML/AI research may also fall into this category. Despite these potential risks, we believe that the fields we plan to cover—detailed above—do not primarily present such concerns.

In cases where our model might be extended to high-risk research—such as new methodologies contributing to terrorism, biological warfare, or uncontrolled AI—the issue of accessibility becomes more complex. We recognize that increasing accessibility in these areas might potentially pose risks.

While we don't expect these concerns to be raised frequently about _The Unjournal_'s activities, we remain committed to supporting thoughtful discussions and risk assessments around these issues.
