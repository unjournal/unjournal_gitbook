# Aside: Open access and 'information hazards'

We recognize that in some contexts [there are legitimate concerns](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9009689/) that making research (methods, tools, results, etc.) more accessible may bring “information hazards’. This is particularly relevant in the context of direct physical and biological science research, particularly in areas relevant to biosecurity (although there is also a case that specific [open science practices may be beneficial for biosecurity](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001600)). ML/AI research may also fall into this category. However, we believe this is mainly not a relevant concern given the research fields we plan to cover, as discussed above. To the extent models like The Unjournal are extended to research developing new methods that may contribute to large risks (terrorism, biological warfare, uncontrolled AI, etc.), we agree that greater accessibility may bring risks. Although we expect this concern is unlikely to be raised in relation to The Unjournal activities, we plan to support careful consideration and discussion of such risks.&#x20;
