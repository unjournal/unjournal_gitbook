# What is global-priorities-relevant research?

On this page we link to and discuss [some takes](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] on answers to the questions, _Which research is most impactful? Which research should be prioritized?_

At The Unjournal, we are open to various approaches to the issues of "what is the most impactful research"?  Perhaps looking at some of the research, we have already evaluated and research we are prioritizing (public link coming soon) will give you some insights. However, it seems fair that we should give at least one candidate description or definition.

## A candidate description/definition; 'direct global impact of research'

The **direct global impact of a work of research**  is determined by the _value of the information_ that it provides in helping individuals, governments, funders, and policymakers make better decisions. While research may not definitively answer key questions it should leave us more informed (in a Bayesian sense, 'more concentrated belief distributions') about these. We will measure the value of these 'better choices' in terms of the extent these [improve the welfare of humans and other sentient beings, and the survival and flourishing of life and human civilization and values. ](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]

The above comes close to how some people on The Unjournal team think about research impact and prioritization, but we don't plan to adopt an official guiding definition.&#x20;

Note the above definition is meant to exclude more _basic_ research, which may also be high value, but which mainly serves as a building block for other research. In fact, The Unjournal _does_ consider the value of research as an input into other research, particularly when it directly influences direct policy-relevant  research, e.g., see ["Replicability & Generalisability: A Guide to CEA discounts" ](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumtemplateapplied/release/1?readingCollection=02bc1831).

It also excludes the value of "learning the truth" as an intrinsic good; we have tended not to make this a priority.

For more guidance on how we apply this, see our [#high-level-considerations-for-prioritizing-research](policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/considering-projects/what-research-to-target.md#high-level-considerations-for-prioritizing-research "mention").

## **Funder/organization research agendas**

We next consider organizations that take a broad focus on helping humans, animals, and the future of civilization. Some of these have explicitly set priorities and research agendas, although the level of specificity varies. Most of the organizations below have some connections to Effective Altruism; over time, we aim to also look beyond this EA focus.

### [Global Priorities Institute research agenda](https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/research-agenda-web-version/) (2020)

<details>

<summary>GPI research agenda – considerations</summary>

GPI focuses on _prioritization_ research—what to prioritize and why; how to make these decisions. They focus less on how to _implement_ improvements and interventions.

The agenda is divided into "The longtermism paradigm" and "General issues in global prioritisation."

The agenda focuses largely on formal theory (in philosophy, economics, and decision science) and, to a lesser extent., methodology. They aim to identify and inform "crucial considerations," and rarely focus on specific impact assessments.

Nonetheless, the agenda cites some empirical and directly policy-relevant work, and there are suggestions (e.g., from Eva Vivalt) that they might move more towards this in the future.

[^1]: Note: Most of these links are associated with Effective Altruism; we intend to include a wider range of sources soon. This page is very much a work-in-progress.

[^2]: Obviously, we have not defined how to measure "welfare improvements"  here.



[^3]: However, I'm seeing little follow-through on these and some of the white papers seem hard to dig up.



[^4]: In more detail: National Science Foundation’s Directorate for the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (NSF/SBE) challenged economists and other relevant research communities “to step outside of present demands and to think boldly about future promises.” Specifically, NSF/SBE invited groups and individuals in August 2010 to write white papers that describe grand challenge questions in their sciences that transcend near-term funding cycles and are “likely to drive next generation research in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences.”
