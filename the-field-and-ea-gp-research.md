## **Funder/organization research agendas**

### [Global Priorities Institute research agenda](https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/research-agenda-web-version/) (2020)

<details>

<summary>GPI research agenda – considerations</summary>

GPI focuses on _prioritization_ research – what to prioritize and why; how to consider this. They focus less on 'how to _implement_ improvements and interventions'.

The agenda is divided into "The longtermism paradigm", and "General issues in global prioritisation".

It focuses largely on formal theory (in philosophy, economics, and decision science), and to a lesser extent. methodology. They aim to identify and inform "crucial considerations", and rarely focus on specific impact-assessments.

Nonetheless, the agenda cites some empirical and directly-policy-relevant work, and there are suggestions (e.g., from Eva Vivalt) that they might move more towards this in the future.

## Other agendas and discussions

_To be expanded, catalogued, and considered in more detail,_

[Happier Lives Institute](https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/research-agenda.html) [research agenda](https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/research-agenda.html) ('research priorities') (2021): A particularly well-organized discussion. Each section has a list of relevant academic literature, some of which is recent and some of which is applied or empirical.

[Animal Charity Evaluators](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/): The '[Methodology](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/methodology/)' and 'Research briefs' are particularly helpful, and connect to a range of academic and policy research

Open Philanthropy [“Technical and Philosophical Questions That Might Affect Our Grantmaking”](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/technical-and-philosophical-questions-might-affect-our-grantmaking): fairly brief discussion and overview, links mostly to OP-funded research

[Rethink Priorities 2021 strategy (forum post)](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/33AnPajNYmNrdXQbj/rethink-priorities-2020-impact-and-2021-strategy): Some directional suggestions under "Our research going forward is expected to focus on"

[UNICEF strategic plan](https://www.unicef.org/reports/unicef-strategic-plan-2022-2025): Not easy to link to research; they have a large number of priorities, goals, and principles; see infographic: <img src=".gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt="" data-size="line">
