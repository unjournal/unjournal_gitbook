# Instructions for Claude-in-Browser: Add Supporters Section to Squarespace

## Goal

Add an "Our Supporters" section near the bottom of the Unjournal homepage at unjournal.org, recognizing the organizations that have funded our work. Also add some cross-links to info.unjournal.org landing pages.

## Part 1: Add "Our Supporters" section to the homepage

### Step-by-step

1. Navigate to `https://www.unjournal.org` and log into the Squarespace editor (click the Squarespace login if needed, or navigate to `https://lanternfish-reindeer-zhcx.squarespace.com` to access the editor).

2. Once in the editor, open the **Homepage** for editing.

3. Scroll to near the bottom of the page — ideally just above the footer or any final CTA section.

4. **Add a new section.** In the Squarespace 7.1 editor:
   - Hover between sections to see the "Add Section" button (the `+` icon between content blocks)
   - Click it to add a new blank section

5. **Set the section heading** to: `Our Supporters`

6. **Add a subtitle/text block** below the heading with this text:
   > We're grateful to the organizations that have funded our work and helped build open research evaluation.

7. **Add the funder names as linked text or image blocks.** The three funders are:

   | Organization | URL |
   |---|---|
   | Survival and Flourishing Fund | https://survivalandflourishing.fund/ |
   | Long-Term Future Fund | https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future |
   | EA Infrastructure Fund | https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/ea-community |

   **Preferred approach — Image blocks with logos:**
   - If you can find logos online for these organizations, add them as image blocks in a row (use a Gallery section or a row of Image blocks)
   - Link each image to the organization's URL above
   - Set alt text to the organization name

   **Fallback approach — Text with links:**
   - Add a text block with the three names as links, separated by spacing or in a centered layout
   - Style them as bold/heading text so they stand out visually

8. **Add a soft CTA line** below the logos:
   > Want to support open research evaluation? [Donate](https://info.unjournal.org/donate/) or [get in touch](https://calendly.com/daaronr) to discuss.

9. **Style the section:**
   - Background: light/white (match the rest of the page)
   - Text alignment: centered
   - Padding: comfortable spacing above and below (the default section padding should work)

10. **Save and publish** the changes.

## Part 2: Add cross-links to info.unjournal.org pages

Add these links somewhere appropriate on the Squarespace site — either in the navigation, footer, or as buttons/links within relevant pages. The most natural placements:

### Links to add

| Link text | URL | Where to place it |
|---|---|---|
| Support Us / Donate | https://info.unjournal.org/donate/ | Main navigation or as a button in footer/CTA sections |
| Follow & Stay Updated | https://info.unjournal.org/follow/ | Footer links, or a "Stay Connected" section |
| Forecasting Tournament | https://info.unjournal.org/forecasting-tournament/ | Link from any "Current Projects" or "Get Involved" area |
| Evaluator Prizes 2024–25 | https://info.unjournal.org/evaluator-prizes-2024-25/ | Link from the "For Evaluators" page |

### Suggested placements

**In the site footer:**
- Add "Support Us" linking to `https://info.unjournal.org/donate/`
- Add "Follow Us" linking to `https://info.unjournal.org/follow/`

**As a CTA button on the homepage:**
- Add a prominent "Support Our Work" or "Donate" button linking to `https://info.unjournal.org/donate/` — consider placing it near the "Our Supporters" section you just created

**On the "For Evaluators" page (if one exists):**
- Link to the evaluator prizes page: `https://info.unjournal.org/evaluator-prizes-2024-25/`

**On any "Get Involved" or "Current Projects" page:**
- Link to the forecasting tournament: `https://info.unjournal.org/forecasting-tournament/`

## Reference: what i4replication.org does

The site at https://i4replication.org/ has a simple "Our Sponsors" section near the bottom of their homepage with clickable logos in a horizontal row. That's the look we're going for — clean, centered, logo-based with links to funder websites.
