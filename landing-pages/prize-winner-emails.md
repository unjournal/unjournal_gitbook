## 1. First Prize: Masset and Sharma Waddington

**Subject:** You've won The Unjournal's First Prize for Evaluation — congratulations

Dear Edoardo and Hugh,

I'm writing with good news: your evaluation of "Water Treatment and Child Mortality: A Meta-analysis and Cost-effectiveness Analysis" has been selected for the First Prize in The Unjournal's 2024–25 Evaluator Prize. This comes with a substantial financial honorarium in recognition of the outstanding quality of your work.

Your evaluation exemplified rigorous, decision-relevant peer review. It was a rare example of evaluators bringing systematic review and policy expertise directly to bear on a prominent meta-analysis, yielding unusually concrete, implementable recommendations. You identified deviations from the registered protocol, discrepancies in data extraction between drafts, and specific eligible studies that were missing. You flagged methodological fragility linked to headline results — noting that odds ratio estimates differed substantially between working paper drafts — and drew important distinctions between standalone water treatment and multicomponent packages. You questioned potential overstatements regarding Hawthorne effects and contextual representativeness, and raised critical points about the cost-effectiveness analysis.

The authors themselves called the evaluations "thorough and thoughtful" and acknowledged receiving "extensive write-up and precise recommendations," revising the paper's framing in response. We also note that this evaluation package attracted attention from GiveWell, which relies heavily on the Kremer et al. meta-analysis for its chlorination grantmaking. GiveWell's water team described the evaluation as "very influential," and a GiveWell research director confirmed finding it useful — particularly because it flagged issues that should be addressed without finding major smoking guns, helping calibrate confidence in evidence that informs hundreds of millions of dollars in charitable funding.

We're preparing a public announcement of the prize winners and plan to use language along these lines to describe your contribution. Please let us know if anything is inaccurate or if there's anything you'd like adjusted before we publish.

**Sharing and visibility:** We'd welcome your help in sharing news of the prize once it's announced — via social media, professional networks, or however feels natural to you. The more visible the prize is, the more it serves as genuine professional recognition for your work: something that signals the value of rigorous public evaluation to colleagues, funders, and the broader research community.

**Online event:** We're also exploring the idea of hosting a brief online discussion or seminar tied to this evaluation — potentially involving the authors of the water treatment meta-analysis and/or stakeholders who use this evidence (such as GiveWell representatives). Given the real-world policy significance and the interest this evaluation has already generated, we think there could be a genuinely engaged audience for a conversation about the evidence base for water treatment interventions, the role of rigorous meta-analytic review, and what this kind of independent evaluation can contribute. We'd aim to record and share the session so it reaches a wider audience. We have limited funds available to help defray any costs of your time or resources for participating. Would this be of interest to you?

Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions. We'll be in touch shortly with details on the honorarium and next steps.

With appreciation,
David Reinstein

## 2. Joint Second Prize: David Reiley

**Subject:** You've won an Unjournal Evaluator Prize — congratulations

Dear David,

I'm writing with good news: your evaluation of "Does Online Fundraising Increase Charitable Giving? A Nationwide Field Experiment on Facebook" has been selected for a Joint Second Prize in The Unjournal's 2024–25 Evaluator Prize. This comes with a substantial financial honorarium in recognition of the quality of your work.

Your evaluation was among the most detailed and insightful reports in our portfolio. You brought decades of experience in both the economics of charitable giving and digital advertising practice, combining technical credibility checks (researcher degrees of freedom, data treatment robustness, assumptions), practical sector insights (what the results mean for fundraisers, platform dynamics, and measurement choices), and clear decision-facing guidance (how to interpret profit claims, spillovers, and uncertainty). We hope that this evaluation package, with its specific suggestions, leads to followup work — including reanalysis of this high-value field experiment data and further experiments — helping fundraisers for high-impact global charities better understand how to optimize their advertising budgets, considering both the direct returns and the potential crowding-out of donations to related charities.

We're preparing a public announcement of the prize winners and plan to use language along these lines to describe your contribution. Please let us know if anything is inaccurate or if there's anything you'd like adjusted before we publish.

**Sharing and visibility:** We'd welcome your help in sharing news of the prize once it's announced — via social media, professional networks, or however feels natural. The more visible the prize is, the more it serves as genuine professional recognition: something that signals the value of this kind of rigorous, practitioner-informed evaluation to colleagues, funders, and the broader research community.

**Online event:** We're exploring the idea of hosting a brief online event — an informal seminar or discussion — tied to the research you evaluated and the art and science of evaluating research. You might present your evaluation and reflections on what makes charitable fundraising experiments decision-relevant, or we could try to involve the paper's authors in a dialogue. We'd aim to record and share it (e.g., on YouTube) to reach a wider audience. We think this could highlight your expertise and potentially open doors to future research or consulting work in this space. We have limited funds available to help defray the cost of your time. Would this be of interest?

## 3. Joint Second Prize: Eleanor Tsai

**Subject:** You've won an Unjournal Evaluator Prize — congratulations

Dear Eleanor,

I'm writing with good news: your evaluation of "Maternal Cash Transfers for Gender Equity and Child Development: Experimental Evidence from India" has been selected for a Joint Second Prize in The Unjournal's 2024–25 Evaluator Prize. This comes with a substantial financial honorarium in recognition of the quality of your work.

Your evaluation stood out for the way it took a large, rigorous RCT seriously and assessed the issues that decision-makers would actually care about: measurement, interpretation, stress-testing comparisons, and real-world contextual considerations. This is exactly the kind of evaluation we aim to foster — one that goes beyond technical critique to help readers and policymakers understand how much confidence to place in the findings and what they mean in practice.

We're preparing a public announcement of the prize winners and plan to use language along these lines to describe your contribution. Please let us know if anything is inaccurate or if there's anything you'd like adjusted before we publish.

**Sharing and visibility:** We'd welcome your help in sharing news of the prize once it's announced — via social media, professional networks, or however feels natural. The more visible the prize, the more it serves as genuine professional recognition for your work and signals the value of rigorous public evaluation to colleagues, funders, and the broader research community.

**Online event:** We're also exploring the idea of hosting a brief online discussion or seminar connected to this evaluation. This could involve a conversation about the research on maternal cash transfers and gender equity, potentially including the authors or stakeholders working in this area. We'd aim to record and share the session to reach a wider audience. We think this could be a good way to highlight your expertise, build connections, and potentially open doors to future research or consulting opportunities. We have limited funds available to help defray costs. Would this be of interest?

## 4. Joint Second Prize: Cannon Cloud

**Subject:** You've won an Unjournal Evaluator Prize — congratulations

Dear Cannon,

I'm writing with good news: your evaluation of "Global Potential for Natural Regeneration in Deforested Tropical Regions" (Williams et al., 2024, Nature) has been selected for a Joint Second Prize in The Unjournal's 2024–25 Evaluator Prize. This comes with a substantial financial honorarium in recognition of the quality of your work.

Your evaluation showed tremendous effort, follow-through, and specific technical insight. It went well beyond surface-level review, raising critical doubts about the methods and interpretation and offering detailed, actionable recommendations. You identified issues including temporal data leakage, reliance on older Global Forest Change data, confounding by socioeconomic factors, and neglect of intensive margin regrowth. The evaluation also included a constructive dialogue and collaborative synthesis with the second evaluator — the kind of productive, ongoing scholarly engagement that open evaluation can foster. We understand you are in conversation with the authors and pursuing future work in this area, which is exactly the kind of outcome we hope to see from Unjournal evaluations.

We're preparing a public announcement of the prize winners and plan to use language along these lines to describe your contribution. Please let us know if anything is inaccurate or if there's anything you'd like adjusted before we publish.

**Sharing and visibility:** We'd welcome your help in sharing news of the prize once it's announced — via social media, professional networks, or however feels natural. The more visible the prize, the more it serves as professional recognition and signals the value of rigorous public evaluation to colleagues, funders, and the broader research community.

**Online event:** Given the policy significance of tropical forest regeneration — with forest investment needing to more than triple by 2030 according to UNEP — we think there could be real interest in a brief online discussion tied to this evaluation. This might involve a conversation with the Williams et al. authors, or a broader discussion about the role of independent evaluation in environmental science and policy. We'd aim to record and share the session. We have limited funds available to help defray any costs of your time. Would this be of interest?

With appreciation,

## 6. Honorable Mention: Anonymous evaluator (UBI / Kenya)

**Subject:** Unjournal Evaluator Prize — Honorable Mention for your evaluation

Dear [Name],

I'm writing with good news: your evaluation of "Universal Basic Income: Short-Term Results from a Long-Term Experiment in Kenya" has received an Honorable Mention in The Unjournal's 2024–25 Evaluator Prize. As an honorable mention recipient, you are also entered into a prize draw for a substantial financial honorarium — two of our five honorable mention evaluators will be selected by transparent random draw to receive this.

Your evaluation was recognized as a careful, highly detailed, organized, and decision-relevant assessment of one of the most prominent long-term anti-poverty experiments. You provided insightful critiques of causal and statistical inference claims, raised important questions about external validity — including whether this "manna from heaven" experiment can be extrapolated to a standardized, tax-funded UBI — and offered a plausible alternative psychological explanation for the differential impacts on lump-sum versus monthly recipients. Your emphasis on what can and cannot be inferred from short-term results within a long-run design was particularly valuable.

Since you evaluated this paper anonymously, we will describe the evaluation in the public announcement without identifying you. We plan to use language along the lines above. Please let us know if anything is inaccurate or if there's anything you'd like adjusted, or if you have any concerns about the description potentially identifying you.

**Sharing and visibility:** If you're comfortable doing so, we'd welcome any help sharing news of the prize, even without attribution. Of course, we fully respect your choice to remain anonymous.

## 7. Honorable Mention: Gregory Lewis

**Subject:** Unjournal Evaluator Prize — Honorable Mention for your evaluation

Dear Gregory,

I'm writing with good news: your evaluation of "The Returns to Science in the Presence of Technological Risks" has received an Honorable Mention in The Unjournal's 2024–25 Evaluator Prize. As an honorable mention recipient, you are also entered into a prize draw for a substantial financial honorarium — two of our five honorable mention evaluators will be selected by transparent random draw to receive this.

Your evaluation was recognized for exceptional reasoning, writing, quantification, and follow-up work. You made the clearest case among the evaluators that the paper stacks the deck against concluding in favour of a science slowdown by comparing all the benefits of science to only a subset of the risks — namely the risks emerging from biotechnology — and noted that this matters given that XPT AI extinction estimates are 38x higher than biocatastrophe estimates. Your proposed "like for like" fix (narrowing the upside to bioscience returns only) was a constructive contribution. The author, Matt Clancy, praised your "quite a good critique" and responded in detail, adding new analysis — exactly the kind of productive exchange we hope to foster.

We're preparing a public announcement and plan to use language along these lines to describe your contribution. Please let us know if anything is inaccurate or if there's anything you'd like adjusted.

**Sharing and visibility:** We'd welcome your help in sharing news of the prize once it's announced. The more visible, the more it serves as professional recognition and signals the value of this kind of rigorous engagement.

**Online event:** We're exploring hosting brief online events tied to prize-winning evaluations. Given the significance of the science-and-risk topic and the interest it generates, we think there could be a strong audience. If you'd be interested in presenting your evaluation or participating in a discussion — potentially including Matt Clancy or others working on technological risk — we'd love to hear from you. We have limited funds available to help defray costs.

With appreciation,

## 8. Honorable Mention: Anonymous evaluator (Climate Change / Macro)

**Subject:** Unjournal Evaluator Prize — Honorable Mention for your evaluation

Dear [Name],

I'm writing with good news: your evaluation of "The Macroeconomic Impact of Climate Change: Global vs. Local Temperature" has received an Honorable Mention in The Unjournal's 2024–25 Evaluator Prize. As an honorable mention recipient, you are also entered into a prize draw for a substantial financial honorarium — two of our five honorable mention evaluators will be selected by transparent random draw to receive this.

Your evaluation was recognized for its demonstrated impact on the research itself. The authors stated that "the feedback was very helpful and we will make sure to take it into account in the next iteration of the paper" — and the most recent draft strongly suggests they did. For example, they addressed your concerns about sample size and robustness by incorporating a much larger dataset, and they converted their estimates to consider a permanent 1°C temperature rise, yielding the much larger long-run figure of 22–34% GDP reduction. This is a clear case of evaluation improving research.

Since you evaluated this paper anonymously, we will describe the evaluation in the public announcement without identifying you. We plan to use language along the lines above. Please let us know if anything is inaccurate, if there's anything you'd like adjusted, or if you have any concerns about the description potentially identifying you.

**Sharing and visibility:** If you're comfortable doing so, we'd welcome any help sharing news of the prize. We fully respect your choice to remain anonymous.

**Online event:** We're exploring hosting brief online events tied to prize-winning evaluations. If you'd be interested in participating — whether identified or not — in a discussion about climate-economy modelling or the role of evaluation in improving research, we'd love to hear from you. We have limited funds available to help defray costs.

As an honorable mention recipient, you are also entered into a prize draw for a substantial financial honorarium — two of our five honorable mention evaluators will be selected by transparent random draw to receive this.

Your evaluation was recognized for its detail, extensive followup, and the range of helpful suggestions you provided for methods, domain-relevance (leveraging your own clinical expertise), and communication. Your careful and thorough engagement with both the systematic review methodology and the charity-specific cost-effectiveness analysis was exactly the kind of work we aim to foster — evaluation that is useful not just to the authors but to practitioners and funders relying on this evidence.

Since you evaluated this paper anonymously, we will describe the evaluation in the public announcement without identifying you. We plan to use language along the lines above.
