# "Your paper is being (has been) evaluated by The Unjournal"

Within our [direct-evaluation-track.md](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/considering-projects/direct-evaluation-track.md "mention"), _The Unjournal_ directly chooses papers (from prominent archives, well-established researchers, etc.) to evaluate. We don't request authors' permission here.

As you can see in our [evaluation workflow](../../our-policies-evaluation-and-workflow/mapping-evaluation-workflow.md), on this track, we engage with authors at (at least) two points:&#x20;

1. Informing the authors that the evaluation will take place, requesting they engage, and giving them the opportunity to request a [conditional embargo](./#conditional-embargo) or specific types of feedback.
   * &#x20;Of particular interest: are we looking at the most recent version of the paper/project, or is there a further revised version we should be considering instead
2. After the evaluations have been completed, the authors are given two weeks to respond, and have their response posted along with our 'package'. (Authors can also respond after we have posted the evaluations, and we will put their response in the same 'package', with a DOI etc.)



## "But we already revised the paper since the version you evaluated"

E.g. (fictionalized quote)&#x20;

> Over the past six months, we've been in the process of an R\&R with a traditional journal. We've made substantial updates to our paper, including revisions based on feedback from these peer reviews. How can we now respond to critiques of an older version?&#x20;

_How do we deal with this? A general approach..._&#x20;

1. _Paper Version_: The Unjournal aims to evaluate the most recent version of a paper. As noted above, we reach out to authors to ensure we have the latest version at the start of the evaluation process.&#x20;
2. _Updates During Evaluation:_ If substantial updates are made to a paper during the evaluation process, authors are encouraged to share the updated version. We will then inform our evaluators of the update and ask if they wish to revise their comments based on the new version.&#x20;
   * If the timing is such that the evaluators won't be able to respond, we will note this and still link the newest version&#x20;
3. _Author Response_: Authors are encouraged to respond to evaluations by highlighting major revisions made to their paper, especially those relevant to the evaluators' critiques.&#x20;
   * This is easier if we can link the revised version but it can be characterized in general terms  even if the revised version is not ready for public sharing.
   * This 'here is what changed in the new version' should also be useful to general readers who may have seen a previous version of the paper (or a seminar presentation of this). It's good to explain 'here is how this version modifies the previous one'.
4. Placeholder Response: If authors are not ready to respond to evaluations, we can post a placeholder response indicating that a revised version of the paper is forthcoming and that the authors will respond to specific comments when ready.
5. Re-Evaluation: If the authors are willing to engage, The Unjournal is open to re-evaluating a revised version of a paper after publishing the evaluations of the initial version.&#x20;
