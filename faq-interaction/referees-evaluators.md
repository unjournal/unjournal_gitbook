# Evaluation (refereeing)

## Evaluation guidelines and criteria

{% hint style="info" %}
We refer to 'evaluation' because the Unjournal does not _publish_ work; it only links, rates, and evaluates it. However, below, we will mainly refer to traditional terms like 'referees', indicating the same thing. We do this to make it more readable and familiar.
{% endhint %}

_What we are asking evaluators/referees to do:_ [broken-reference](broken-reference/ "mention")

## Choosing and working with evaluators (referees)

### How do we choose evaluators?

* We follow standard procedures, considering complementary expertise, interest, cross-citations, and lack of conflict-of-interest. (See our internal guidelines for[#choosing-and-working-with-evaluators-referees](referees-evaluators.md#choosing-and-working-with-evaluators-referees "mention"))
* We aim to consult those who have opted-in to our referee pool first
* We will favor evaluators with a track record of careful, in-depth, and insightful evaluation (while giving ECRs a chance to build such a record)

### Why do we pay evaluators?

* It is equitable, especially for those not getting 'service credit' for their refereeing work from their employer.
* While researchers currently write reports for prominent traditional journals for free, perhaps in exchange for goodwill when they submit their own work, or a desire to impress prominent editors...
  1. We need to use explicit incentives as the Unjournal grows.
  2. Paying evaluators can reduce [adverse selection and conflict of interest issues (potentially inherent to the traditional process)](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].
* We can use these as incentives for high-quality work.
* We can use payments to access a wider range of expertise, including people not interested in submitting their own work to the Unjournal.

## Evaluator concerns (anonymity, reputation, etc.)

### Anonymity/blinding vs. signed reports

_**Can I submit an evaluation anonymously?**_

\_2023: Yes, o\_ur current policy is to allow evaluators to choose whether they wish to remain anonymous or 'sign their evaluations'.

### _**How do we protect the anonymity of evaluators who request it?**_

See [broken-reference](broken-reference/ "mention")

### I'm concerned about making my evaluation public; what if I make an error or write something in a way that I later regret?

In the typical journal process, reviewers may make mistakes in reports, and these may typically be mitigated by multiple reviewers and editor mediation. Furthermore, in standard journals, reviews are typically not made public. As an Unjournal evaluator, you might be concerned about having an error or poor judgment enter the public record. _How worried should you be, and what can be done to limit this concern?_

1. You can choose to make your evaluation anonymous. You can make this decision from the outset (this is preferable), or later after you've completed your review. This is your choice.
2. Your evaluation will be shared with the authors before it is posted, and they will be given two weeks to respond before we post this. If they cite what they believe are any major misstatements in your evaluation, we will give you the chance to correct these.
3. It is well-known that referee reports/evaluations are subject to mistakes. We expect most people who read your evaluation will take this into account.
4. You can add an addendum/revision to your evaluation later on (see below).

### Can I redact my evaluation/review after it's published through the Unjournal?

We will put your review/evaluation on pubpub ( [https://unjournal.pubpub.org/](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/)) and give it a DOI. It cannot be redacted in the sense that this initial version will remain on the internet in some format. But you can certainly add an addendum to the review later, which we will post and link, and the DOI can be adjusted to point to the revised version.

### (How) are the research authors involved in Unjournal's review process and do they give consent?

See [broken-reference](broken-reference/ "mention") FAQ as well as the [broken-reference](broken-reference/ "mention"). We currently (May 2023) have two ways that papers/research projects enter the Unjournal process:

1. Authors submit their work (perhaps after our reaching out to them); if we believe it is relevant, we assign evaluators, etc. We can also agree with authors to 'embargo' evaluations until a later date, under certain conditions (and evaluators will be informed of this.)
2. Alternatively, we are selecting a set of working papers released in the [prominent NBER series](https://www.nber.org/papers?page=1\&perPage=50\&sortBy=public\_date)\* for evaluation; where these papers seem particularly influential, potentially impactful, and relevant for evaluation. For these, we contact the authors before sending out the papers for evaluation, and request the authors' engagement, but we don't ask for _permission_

(\*Note that papers in the NBER series may enter through either of the above tracks; we will explain this to evaluators).

For either track, authors are invited to be involved in several ways:

* They are informed of the process, and given an opportunity to identify particular concerns, request an embargo, etc.
* Evaluators can be put in touch with authors (anonymously) for clarification questions
* The authors are given a two-week window to respond to the evaluations (and the response gets published as well) before the evaluations are made public. They can also respond on our platform _after_ these are released.

### Can I share this evaluation? What else can I do with this?

If you are writing a signed (not anonymous) review, you can share it or link it on your own pages. Please wait to do this until _after_ we given the author a chance to respond and posted the package (note we as of May 2023 put it up at [unjournal.pubpub.org/](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/)with a DOI and try to get it ito scholarly search engines and bibliometric databases.)

Otherwise, if you are remaining anonymous. please do not disclose your connection to this report.

_Going forward:_

* We may later invite you to write and evaluate more about this piece of research
* ... and to help us judge prizes (e.g., [broken-reference](broken-reference/ "mention")).
* We may ask if you want to be involved in replication exercises (e.g., through [https://i4replication.org/](https://i4replication.org/))
* We hope and intend to always see you are fairly compensated for your time and effort, as a general principle

## Public evaluations

### [How are these hosted and shared?](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]

(2023 update)

* On our [PubPub page](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/) ([unjournal.pubpub.org](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/))
  * Each evaluations and response gets a DOI, linking these into all relevant systems, including Google Scholar
* Previously: [Kotahi](https://kotahi.community/), linked to a [Sciety](https://sciety.org/) group (we aim to mirror PubPub content to our Sciety group and vice-versa)
* Potentially: Hosted/mirrored on our own dedicated web page
* We will present the 'ratings data' in clear, comparable formats, as well as providing the raw data for meta-analysts and others (this is partially available in the pubpub content, and we are working on making this more systematic)

### General criteria/guidelines

See [guidelines-for-evaluators](../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/ "mention") for our current (pilot-stage) approach and template for referees.

1. 22 Dec 2022: We are still developing and improving this system.
2. E.g., for wider audiences, e.g., on Wikipedia, the EA Forum, or Asterisk magazine.
3. _Note_ 10 Dec 2022\_: This is a draft approach; we welcome feedback on the best format.\_

[^1]: E.g., 'Selection': Traditionally, reviewers may be more likely to accept an assignment when they have a particular interest in the paper under consideration
