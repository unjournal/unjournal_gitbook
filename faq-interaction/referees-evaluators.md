# Evaluation (refereeing)



{% hint style="info" %}
We refer to 'evaluation' because the Unjournal does not _publish_ work; it only links, rates, and evaluates it. However, below, we will mainly refer to traditional terms like 'referees', indicating the same thing. We do this to make it more readable and familiar.

## Choosing and working with evaluators (referees)

### How do we choose 'referees'?

* We follow standard procedures, considering complimenatary expertise, interest, cross-citations, and lack of COI
* We aim to consult those who have opted-in to our referee pool first



### Why do we pay evaluators?

* It is equitable, especially for those not getting 'service credit'
* While researchers currently write reports for prominent traditional journals for free (perhaps in exchange for goodwill when they submit their own work) we need to use explicit incentives as the Unjournal grows&#x20;
* We can use these as incentives for high-quality work
* We can use payments to access a wider range of expertise, including people not interested in submitting their own work to the Unjournal

### _**How do we protect the anonymity of evaluators who request it?**_  &#x20;

## Public evaluations

### [How are these hosted and shared?](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

* [Kotahi](https://kotahi.community/), linked to a [Sciety](https://sciety.org/) group (current plan)
* Also hosted/mirrored on our own page (once we set this up)
* Evaluations will have a DOI, linking these into all relevant systems
* We aim to present the 'ratings data' in clear, comparable formats, as well as providing the raw data for meta-analysts and others

## Evaluation guidelines and criteria

### General criteria/guidelines

See [guidelines-for-evaluators](../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/ "mention") for our [current (pilot-stage) approach and template for referees](#user-content-fn-2)[^2].&#x20;

## Anonymity/blinding vs. signed reports

_10 Dec 2022:_ Our current policy is to allow evaluators to choose whether they wish to remain anonymous or 'sign their evaluations'
