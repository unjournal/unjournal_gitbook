# For Researchers/Authors

## General process and requests

### Our current proposed model of the review process (for an established researcher)

We will seek two or three (paid) reviewers with research interests in your area, and with complementary expertise. You will have the opportunity to suggest particular areas in which you are [interested in receiving feedback and suggestions](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. The reviewers will write detailed and helpful evaluations, and [submit them](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] either 'signed' or anonymously. We will also ask the referees to give [some forms of quantitative 'rating' feedback, along with a few overall metrics and predictions about what tier and type of traditional journal this would likely be published in, and where it _should_ be published.](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]  All of these reviews and ratings will typically be made public, but _you will have the right to respond before or after these are posted_.&#x20;

There will be a range of benefits for authors, as discussed below.

We will only need a link to a publicly hosted [DOI'd version of your work](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]. We will not 'publish' your paper, and the fact that we are handling your paper will not limit you in any way. We are fine with you submitting it to any journal before, during, or after the process.

### [Conditional Embargo](#user-content-fn-5)[^5]

By default, we would like Unjournal evaluations to be made public. However, in special circumstances, and particularly for very early-career researchers, we may make exceptions.&#x20;

If there is an early-career researcher on the authorship team, we will allow authors to ‘embargo’ the publication of the evaluation until a later date.  Evaluators (referees) will be informed of this. This date can be contingent, but it should not be indefinite. For example, we might grant an embargo that lasts until after a PhD/postdoc’s upcoming job-market or until after publication in a mainstream journal, [with a hard maximum of 14 months.](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]

In very special circumstances we may consider granting a ['conditional indefinite embargo'.](#user-content-fn-7)[^7]

### What we **ask/request of authors**

If we consider your work for public evaluation, we may ask for _some_ of the below, but these are mainly optional. We will aim to make this very _light touch_ for authors.&#x20;

1. A link to a non-paywalled, hosted version of your work (which could be in any [format - PDFs are not necessary](#user-content-fn-8)[^8]), which [could be given a DOI](#user-content-fn-9)[^9].&#x20;
2.  A link to data and code, if possible. We will work to help you to make it accessible.

    Note our project is not [_principally_ about replication, and we are unlikely to be able to do this systematically in our pilot stage](#user-content-fn-10)[^10].
3. Responses to [clarification questions from our evaluators](#user-content-fn-11)[^11]
4. The evaluations and ratings will be posted publicly (and themselves given a DOI).  We will allow you the 'right to respond' before any of [this is posted publicly.](#user-content-fn-12)[^12]

## **Why should researchers and groups ‘submit their work to’ and engage with the Unjournal?**

_The biggest_ [_personal gains for authors are:_](#user-content-fn-13)[^13]__

1. **Substantive feedback** will help you improve your work (both the work being reviewed and future work). Substantive and useful feedback is often very hard to get, especially for young scholars.&#x20;
2. **Ratings = Markers of credibility for your work** that could help your career advancement at least at the margin, [and hopefully in the future help a great deal](#user-content-fn-14)[^14].
3. The opportunity to **publicly respond to critiques and correct misunderstandings**.
4. [An **additional opportunity for evaluation**](#user-content-fn-15)[^15] **** of your work with an emphasis on **impact.**
5. **Visibility** and a connection to the EA/Global Priorities communities and the Open Science movement. This may lead to grant opportunities, open up new ambitious projects, and attract strong Ph.D. students to your research groups.&#x20;
6. Gain a reputation as an ‘**early adopter and innovator**’ in open science.
7. **Prizes:** You may win a [impactful-research-prize](../readme/call-for-participants-research/impactful-research-prize/ "mention") which will be financial as well as reputational.
8. 'Entering our system’ makes you more likely to be hired as a paid reviewer or editorial manager.&#x20;
9. We will encourage **media coverage**, including ‘forwarding’ some work to the [Asterisk](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Mts84Mv5cFHRYBBA8/introducing-asterisk)[ magazine](https://asteriskmag.com/) for future coverage (with compensation to those doing the writing).

<details>

<summary>What sort of 'additional opportunity'?</summary>

Your work may be "under-published"; perhaps you were in a hurry and submitted it to a 'safe but low-ranked journal'

It may have been evaluated, by a journal in _one field,_ but it needs feedback and credibility from _other fields_ (e.g., theory vs. empirics, etc.)

You may have substantially improved and extended the work since the publication

You may have 'used up' the good journals in your field, or otherwise 'fallen through the cracks'; perhaps the paper is very impactful and the empirics are strong, but the field doesn't see it as innovative or clever. You  need another opportunity.

## **Is it ‘risky’ to have your work evaluated in The Unjournal?**

There are risks and rewards to any activity of course, and we cannot predict the consequences of any given action. We consider some ‘risks’ you may weigh against the benefits mentioned above.

1. “Exclusivity”
2. Public negative/neutral feedback
3. Backlash against innovation or ‘seeming weird’?
4. Could the review process have a downward bias?

### **Exclusivity**

[Some traditional journals might have restrictions on the public sharing of your work](#user-content-fn-16)[^16], and perhaps they might enforce these more strongly if they fear competition from the Unjournal?&#x20;

* The Unjournal is _not exclusive_. Having your paper reviewed and evaluated in the Unjournal will not limit your options; [you can still submit your work to traditional journals.](#user-content-fn-17)[^17]
* Following a traditional publishing route can also be risky: the world may change, and you may be seen as retrograde.&#x20;
* More importantly, publishing (especially in Economics) is slow and has highly variable outcomes. You typically wait months for a response, sometimes more than a year, may go through many cycles of rejection/revisions and resubmitting, and may ultimately end up with an outcome (rejection) that has zero value on your CV.&#x20;
  * With the Unjournal your work will always be given feedback, an evaluation, and a public rating. And you can continue to improve your work for future evaluation.

### **Public negative/neutral feedback**

Our plan is to make reviews, feedback, and evaluations public. While there has been some movement towards open review, this is still not the standard mode. Typically when you submit your paper and it gets rejected, you, your co-authors, the editor, and the people who wrote the reviews are the only people who actually know/see this.

With the Unjournal you might get feedback and evaluation that is sometimes negative, and this may be made public. Is this an acceptable risk? I think so. Most academics expect that there will be many differing opinions about a piece of work, and everyone has received negative reviews throughout their career.

Suppose instead, you go the standard route, put out a working paper, and submit your paper to a sequence of journals. Suppose you present it at many seminars and finally get it published, let's say three years later (not uncommon in Economics), in a middle-status field journal. Will people think that your paper was perfect and not criticized at all? Of course not. If it had been the perfect paper it would have been immediately accepted at a ‘top journal’. And the people in your field would have been the reviewers, attended seminars, and heard all the critiques of the paper.

Thus, ‘getting public mixed and negative feedback’ in the Unjournal (or anywhere) should not particularly harm you or your research project.

_And this should be weighed against the benefits to having your work in the Unjournal._&#x20;

* Your willingness to engage with this shows that you have confidence in your work and are willing to back it in public.&#x20;
* The Unjournal will give authors a place to publicly respond to the critiques, to improve your work, and show how it has improved. Through The Unjournal, you may also have a chance for a second evaluation of the same project after iterations and improvements.

These are all major advantages over the traditional journal route, where you essentially start over with each new submission, and new referees may overlook the same point and have the same misunderstandings each time.

_Nonetheless, w_e are planning some exceptions for early-career researchers, [in some cases _not publicly revealing_ negative evaluations of work (and informing referees of this in advance)](for-researchers-authors.md#conditional-embargo).

### **Backlash against innovation or ‘seeming weird’**

Although the process is unusual, the Unjournal is not a weird concept: we are providing evaluation and feedback on research, largely with standard metrics. We are simply 'not tying it to journals'.

### **Could our reviews tend to 'hurt papers more than help them' ?**

Unjournal evaluations should be seen as signals of research quality. Like all such signals, they are noisy. But authors may worry 'a bad signal will hurt a lot, and a good signal will only help a littl'".

_Arguments against this:_ Unbiased informational signals won't systematically lead to updates in one direction. Fancy ways of saying this and related concepts: [Martingales](https://galton.uchicago.edu/\~lalley/Courses/313/Martingales.pdf), [Conservation of Expected Evidence](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/conservation-of-expected-evidence), Rational Expectations, the Law of Iterated Expectations.

In other words, people will take this into account. If a reviewer evaluates a paper without much information on how others rate it, they might _suspect_ that there have been some substantial and important criticisms, and that the paper has flaws. This is particularly the case if it has been around a while, they are submitting to a second-tier journal, etc.&#x20;

On the other hand, if I see that the author has submitted it to a transparent assessment service like the Unjournal, particularly if the author has submitted a lot of his or her work to this sort of public scrutiny, I will update positively, all else being equal. The author has demonstrated they are not afraid of public feedback and openness. I will consider the public critiques, of course, but I will take into account that this paper has been held up to more scrutiny than other work I might have seen.

Of course, one cannot rule out that a negative evaluation will harm a paper's reputation, or its 'publication chances' in any particular instance. I just don't expect this to occur _systematically._  \

_If getting any public feedback was so damaging, why would academics be eager to present their work at seminars and conferences?_

[^1]: You could also suggest reviewer names, but we may or may not choose these in  particular.

[^2]: We're aiming to have these submissions go through our [Kotahi](https://kotahi.community) interface.

[^3]: See: [guidelines-for-evaluators](../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/ "mention"). Where the paper has already been published, we elicit counterfactual responses.&#x20;

[^4]: We can help you to do this, if you need. We will also ask for other relevant links, such as a 'permalink to updates', if you would like to give one.

[^5]: If you would like to request an exception to a public evaluation, you will have the opportunity to explain your reasoning in the submission form.

[^6]: Of course, this can be ended early at the request of the authors.

[^7]: E.g., where evaluations with ratings below a certain value will never be made public. In such cases, the evaluators will be informed of this in advance, and, if we publish some evaluations of the paper,  it will be noted that this policy was in place.

[^8]: , see [“Benefits of dynamic documents"](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/benefits-and-features/benefits-of-dynamic-documents)

[^9]: Again, remember that _we_ will not be "publishing" this work, just evaluating it.. We can help you figure out how to host and 'DOI it', however.

[^10]: However,  we want to encourage this accessibility (and we are keen to work with [I4rep](https://i4replication.org/people.html) and others on this in future.)

[^11]: Recall that we assign 2-3 evaluators ('referees') who will be paid to assess your work, who may be anonymous (22 Dec 2022: we are giving evaluators this choice).\
    \
    &#x20;We may try to facilitate a confidential channel to enable a dialogue with the authors. \
    \
    In future iterations, rhrough this process, we may encourage you to continue to update your work in communication with the evaluators, as sort of 'dynamic R\&R'.

[^12]: We are considering whether your response may also be given a DOI. This may help the metrics enter into the general bibliometric systems

[^13]: And remember:  you are not giving up any opportunity to publish it elsewhere.

[^14]: Hopefully, with retrograde rewards for early adopters.

[^15]: What sort of 'additional opportunity'? Your work may be "under-published"; perhaps you were in a hurry and submitted it to a 'safe but low-ranked journal'

    It may have been evaluated, by a journal in _one field,_ but it needs feedback and credibility from _other fields_ (e.g., theory vs. empirics, etc.)

    You may have substantially improved and extended the work since the publication

    You may have 'used up' the good journals in your field, or otherwise 'fallen through the cracks'; perhaps the paper is very impactful and the empirics are strong, but the field doesn't see it as innovative or clever. You  need another opportunity. &#x20;

[^16]: We think this is largely not a factor, as discussed below. &#x20;

[^17]: At least _we_ are not making any exclusivity restrictions. Some journals might discourage you from publicly posting your work (a ‘pre-print’), but my impression is that this restriction is becoming less and less common or defensible. In Economics, for example, it seems to not be a thing.
