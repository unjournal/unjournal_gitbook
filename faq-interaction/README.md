## General FAQs

### **What is the Unjournal? (see** [**here**](../readme-1/#in-a-nutshell)**)**

We will organize and fund **public journal-independent feedback, rating, and evaluation of hosted** [_**papers and dynamically presented projects**_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]**.** We will focus on work that is highly relevant to global priorities (especially in economics, social science, and impact evaluation). We will encourage better research by making it easier for researchers to get feedback and credible ratings on their work.

### **Does the Unjournal charge fees to anyone?**

**No**. The Unjournal does not charge any fees. In fact, we compensate evaluators for their time, and award prizes for strong work (in contrast to most traditional journals).

We are a nonprofit organization [(hosted by OCF)](https://opencollective.com/the-unjournal). We do not charge fees for access, and work to make it as open as possible.\
\
At some point in the future we might consider sliding-scale fees for people submitting their work for Unjournal evaluation, or for other services. If we do this, it would simply be as a way to cover the compensation we pay evaluators, and to cover our costs. Again, we are a _nonprofit_ and we will stay that way.

### **Is the Unjournal a journal?**

**No**, we will not ‘publish’ any research; we will just commission _public evaluation_ and _rating_ of relevant research. Having your work evaluated in _The Unjournal_ should not limit you from submitting [it to any publication](#user-content-fn-2)[^2].

## Where does The Unjournal's funding come from, and how will it be sustainable?

At the moment, we have [grants](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/readme-1/latest-updates#update-on-recent-progress-6-may-2023) from philanthropists and organizations who are particularly interested in the credibility of the research areas we are prioritizing. Ideally, I hope that the research and the evaluation output will provide high enough value to justify further direct funding. We might also aim for funding from governments and universities supporting the open-access agenda. I am not sure whether we would want or need to tie this to any bespoke services we would provide to these entities; I'm very concerned about conflicts of interest. We might also look into other options to help sustain our processes, such as sliding-scale submission fees to cover the cost of paying evaluators.

[^1]: &#x20;We encourage the submission of a range of formats, including dynamic documents. See [dynamic-documents-vs-living-projects](../benefits-and-features/dynamic-documents-vs-living-projects/ "mention"). However, we mainly refer to these as "papers" throughout our web page, for simplicity&#x20;

[^2]: The only possible exception we can think of is that we require that the evaluation must be linked to a publicly hosted version of the paper (working paper, preprint. etc.) Some journals and publishing houses have tried to forbid authors from hosting any other versions of their work. However, this is clearly not the case in economics nor in most of the fields we are focusing on. Pre-journal-publication working papers are ubiquitous and commonplace.
