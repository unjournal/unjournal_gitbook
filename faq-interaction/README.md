# FAQ (for authors & evaluators)

_**We want to get authors, research groups, reviewers, and institutions involved, and to support this. They may have doubts, which we try to anticipate and answer throughout this section.**_



## General FAQs

### **What is the Unjournal? (see** [**here**](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/)**)**

We will organize and fund **public journal-independent feedback, rating, and evaluation of hosted papers and dynamically-presented research projects.** We will focus on work that is highly relevant to global priorities (especially in economics, social science, and impact evaluation). We will encourage better research by making it easier for researchers to get feedback and credible ratings on their work.

### **Is the Unjournal a journal?**

**No**, we will not ‘publish’ any research; we will just commission _public evaluation_ and _rating_ of relevant research. Having your work evaluated in the Unjournal should not limit you from submitting [it to any publication](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

[^1]: The only possible exception we can think of is that we require the evaluation  be linked to a publicly hosted version of the paper (working paper, preprint. etc.) Some journals and publishing houses have tried to forbid authors from hosting any other versions of their work. However, this is clearly not the case in economics and in most of the fields we are focusing on. Pre-journal-publication working papers are ubiquitous and commonplace.
