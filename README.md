# The Unjournal

[The Unjournal](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/scEoiIiYYQByE1FaibWQ/) is making research better by evaluating what really matters. We aim to make rigorous research more impactful and impactful research more rigorous.

The academic journal system is out-of-date. It wastes resources, discourages innovation, and encourages rent-seeking.

_The Unjournal is not a journal_. We donâ€™t publish research. Instead, we commission (and pay for) _open_, _rigorous_ expert evaluation of publicly-hosted research. We make it easier for researchers to get feedback and credible ratings of their work, so they can focus on _doing better research_ rather than journal-shopping.

We currently focus on quantitative work that informs global priorities, especially in economics, policy, and social science. Our [evaluation packages](https://unjournal.pubpub.org) help policymakers and practitioners understand which research to trust and how to use it. These provide open critique and discussion to benefit students and the research community.
