# The Unjournal

[The Unjournal](https://unjournal.org/) is making research better by evaluating what really matters. We aim to make _rigorous_ research more _impactful_ and _impactful_ research more _rigorous_.

Today's research evaluation process is _out-of-date_, it _discourages innovation,_ and it _encourages rent-seeking_. We provide _open_, _rigorous_ evaluation, focused on what's _practically important_ to researchers, policy-makers, and the world. We make it easier for researchers to get feedback and credible ratings of their work.

We currently focus on quantitative work that informs global priorities, especially in economics, policy, and social science.
