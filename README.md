# The Unjournal

[The Unjournal](https://unjournal.org/) commissions public expert evaluation of open-access research: to make _rigorous_ research more _impactful_ and _impactful_ research more _rigorous_. We prioritize work that concretely informs global priorities, focusing on economics, quantitative social science, and policy.&#x20;

Today's research evaluation process is out-of-date. Traditional journals capture rents while discouraging innovative formats. The current publish-or-perish incentive diverts researcher energy away from their core work and towards playing strategic journal-submission games.

The Unjournal provides _open_, _rigorous_ evaluation, focusing on credibility, robustness, transparency, communication, and usefulness. We make it easier for researchers to get feedback and credible assessment of their work, so they can focus on _doing better and more useful research_. We publish and disseminate these evaluation reports and benchmarked ratings; often far earlier than traditional journals. This helps policymakers understand what research to trust and how to use it, and it helps other researchers and students learn from the critique and discussion.
