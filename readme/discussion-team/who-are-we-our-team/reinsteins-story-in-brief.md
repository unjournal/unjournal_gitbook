# Reinstein's story in brief

[davidreinstein.org](https://davidreinstein.org)&#x20;



I was in academia for about 20 years (PhD Economics, UC Berkeley; Lecturer, University of Essex; Senior Lecturer; University of Exeter). \
\
I saw how the journal system was broken.&#x20;

* Academics constantly complain about it (but don't do anything to improve it.)
* Most conversations are not about research but about 'who got into what journal' and 'tricks to getting your paper into journals'
* Open science and replicability is great, and dynamic documents make research a lot more transparent and readable. But this is very hard to do within the traditional journal system and its 'pdf prisons'.

Now I'm working outside academia, and I can stick my neck out. I have the opportunity to help fix the system. I work at the research organization Rethink Priorities, and I'm in touch with large philanthropists involved with effective altruism. They care about the _results_ of research in areas that are relevant to global priorities. They want research to be reliable, robust, reasoning transparent, and well-communicated. Bringing them into the equation can change the game.
