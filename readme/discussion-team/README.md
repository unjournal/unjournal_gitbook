# Our team, discussion, plans

<summary>Discussion space</summary>

We’ve had fruitful discussions in the previous essay and discussion Gdoc “[Slaying the journals](../writings/#slaying-the-journals-google-doc-aimed-at-ea-gp-academic-and-open-science-audiences-link)”...

I’m starting [this new Gdoc space](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ojb3a2X12av3c97wezYD6zLRkdo1xlx5r21cblf11JY/edit?usp=sharing) (embedded at bottom) to enable easy discussion and suggestions. (I had previously suggested the Gitbook for that, but Gdoc seems the best lingua franca). I’ll try to incorporate the discussion here into the gitbook (with attribution)\

_Please "@" me in that Gdoc space if you make a comment; I visit it only infrequently_
