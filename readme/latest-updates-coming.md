## Update on recent progress: 19 Feb 2023

Some quickies...

#### **Content and 'publishing'**

1. Our [Sciety Group](https://sciety.org/groups/the-unjournal/about) is up...&#x20;
2. With our [first posted evaluation](https://sciety.org/lists/55026c6d-0dc2-46c0-96c1-e0c944c404ed) ("Long Term Cost-Effectiveness of Resilient Foods"... Denkenberger et al. Evaluations from Scott Janzwood, Anca Hanea, and Alex Bates,  and an author response.
3. Two more evaluations 'will be posted soon' (waiting for final author responses.
4. We are working on six more papers (projects), most of which are part of our NBER[direct-evaluation-track.md](../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/considering-projects/direct-evaluation-track.md "mention")

#### Funding, plans, collaborations

We are seeking grant funding for our continued operation and expansion (see [grants-and-proposals](../grants-and-proposals/ "mention") below). We're appealing to funders interested in Open Science and in impactful research.&#x20;

We're considering collaborations with other compatible initiatives, including...

* replication/reproducability/robystness initiatives,&#x20;
* prediction and replication markets,&#x20;
* and projects involving the elicitation and 'aggregation of expert and stakeholder beliefs' (about both replication and outcomes themselves).

#### Management and administration

We are now under the [Open Collective Foundation](https://opencollective.com/the-unjournal) 'fiscal sponsorship' (this does not entail funding, only a legal and administrative home).

#### Other news and media

EA Forum: recent post and AMA (answering questions about the Unjournal's progress, plans, and relation to effective-altruism-relevant research:&#x20;
