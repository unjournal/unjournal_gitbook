# Brief version of call

I (David Reinstein) am an economist who left UK academia after 15 years to pursue a range of projects ([see my web page](http://davidreinstein.org/)). One of these projects is The[ Unjournal](http://bit.ly/eaunjournal):

> The Unjournal (with funding from the [Long Term Future Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future)) organizes and funds public journal-independent feedback and evaluation, paying reviewers for their work. We focus on research that is highly relevant to global priorities (especially in economics, social science, and impact evaluation). We will encourage better research by making it easier for researchers to get feedback and credible ratings on their work.

We are in the pilot phase, and choosing a small number of particularly relevant papers to evaluate. We are looking for:

1. _Evaluators:_ Researchers interested in doing evaluation work for The Unjournal. We pay $250-$350 per review (update June 2023: we will be increasing these incentives), and we will award further monetary prizes for the most informative evaluations. Right now we are particularly looking for economists and people with quantitative and policy-evaluation skills. We describe what we are asking evaluators to do [here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/policies-and-templates/guideline-for-evaluators): essentially a regular peer review with some different emphases, and providing some quantitative ratings and predictions. Your evaluation content would be made public (and get a DOI, etc.), but you can choose if you want to be anonymous or not.\
   \
   _To sign up to be part of the pool of evaluators (or to get involved in the Unjournal project in other ways) please_ [_fill out this brief form_](https://airtable.com/shrW9xpIrxNGfxkXW)_, or contact theunjournal@gmail.com_



2. _Research:_ Suggestions for particularly impactful research that would benefit from (further) public evaluation. We choose research for public evaluation based on an initial assessment of methodological strength, openness, clarity, relevance to [global priorities](../../the-field-and-ea-gp-research/what-is-ea-gp-relevant-research.md), and the usefulness of further evaluation and public discussion. We sketch [these criteria here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/policies-and-templates/considering-projects), and give some potential examples [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see#Some\_suggested\_\_sort\_of\_things\_we\_might\_be\_looking\_for\_).\
   \
   If you have research (your own or others) you would like us to assess, please fill out [_THIS FORM_](https://airtable.com/shrdHHI0zK7rkJCP3). You can submit your own work [here](https://unjournaldev.cloud68.co/login) (or by contacting [theunjournal@gmail.com](mailto:theunjournal@gmail.com)). _Authors_ of evaluated papers will be eligible for our [Impactful Research Prizes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DAgVYq0LW5\_sx30XP7PeM3isBzsxvivqzxDFsZao7TA/edit?usp=sharing) (initial prizes: $2000, $1000; these may be increased if funds permit).



2. Feedback on, and involvement in the Unjournal project. Feel free to reach out to [theunjournal@gmail.com](mailto:theunjournal@gmail.com).\
