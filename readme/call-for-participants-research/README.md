<summary>Updates</summary>

**June 2023:** We are expanding the [Management Committee](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], the Advisory Board, and the Reviewer pool. We also anticipate hiring/contracting for several roles.&#x20;



**Dec. 2022:** "_Needs are ongoing_". We have chosen people for the Founding Committee, but please complete the form anyways if you are interested. We're still very interested in people for the Advisory Board and Reviewer Pool, and aim to expand the Management Committee soon.

_Update/reminder Oct 2022: Authors_ of evaluated papers will be eligible for our [Impactful Research Prizes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DAgVYq0LW5\_sx30XP7PeM3isBzsxvivqzxDFsZao7TA/edit?usp=sharing) (initial prizes: ~~$2000~~, $2500, $1000)

## Overview and call

[I am](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] [David Reinstein](https://www.davidreinstein.org/), founder and co-director[^3] of The Unjournal. We have an [open call](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] for committee members, board members, reviewers, and suggestions of relevant work for The Unjournal to evaluate.

The [Unjournal team](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/master/discussion-team/who-are-we-our-team) is building a system for credible, public, journal-independent feedback and evaluation of research. Peer review can be slow; our system will enable researchers to get more prompt, efficient, and substantive feedback and advice, with metrics and signals of quality. The Unjournal will also help researchers advance, promote, and improve their work, while still allowing them to submit it to traditional journals at any point in the process.

Our initial focus: research relevant to [global priorities](https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org), particularly in the fields of quantitative social science (including economics) and impact evaluation. We aim to encourage posting research in public, [open formats that support replicability and robustness](#user-content-fn-5)[^5]. Rather than ‘finished frozen publications’, we wish to foster a [living approach](../../benefits-and-features/living-research-projects.md) to research projects; we hope that the research we review will be improved, extended, and may even be re-assessed in future versions.

_Briefly, The Unjournal’s process is:_

* Identify or invite contributions of relevant research _that_ [_is publicly hosted_](#user-content-fn-6)[^6] on any open platform or archive in any format.
* Pay evaluators to give careful feedback on this work. Elicit quantifiable and comparable metrics of research quality as credible measures of value (see: [evaluator guidelines](../../policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/)).
* [Publicly post](#user-content-fn-7)[^7] and link all reviews of the work. Award financial prizes for work judged strongest.
* Allow _evaluators_ to choose if they wish to remain anonymous or to 'sign their reviews.'
* Aim to be as transparent as possible in these processes.



We maintain an **open call for participants** for three different roles:

1. Management committee members (involving honorariums for time spent)
2. Advisory board members (supporters, unpaid, no time commitment)
3. A pool of evaluators (who will be paid for their time and their work; we may draw reviewers from outside this pool, of course).

The roles are explained in more detail below; you can express your interest and enter our database [here](https://airtable.com/shrtMv4hNlv8aL7Yy).

We are also looking for high-quality, globally-pivotal research projects to evaluate, particularly those embodying open science practices and innovative formats. We are putting out a call for relevant research (with [some potential bounties and prizes](#user-content-fn-8)[^8])_._&#x20;

For details of what we are looking for, and some potential examples, [see this post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see), and accompanying links.

## Organizational roles and responsibilities

### **Management Committee Members**&#x20;

Activities involve:

* Collaborating with other committee members on the establishment of rules and guidelines, such as determining the metrics for research evaluation and defining the mode of assessment publication.
* Helping plan The Unjournal’s future path.
* If feasible, contributing to the decision-making process regarding research focus, reviewer assignment, and prize distribution. This responsibility will be kept light.

[**Time commitment**](#user-content-fn-9)[^9]: A minimum of 20 hours total over the next 18 months.

**Compensation**: We have funding for a $65 per hour honorarium for the first 20 hours, with possible compensation for additional work. [Evaluation management work](../../management-tech-details-discussion/management-process/) will be further compensated (at roughly $300–$450 per paper).&#x20;

**Who we are looking for**: All applicants are welcome. We are especially interested in those involved in global priorities research (and related fields), policy research and practice, open science and meta-science, bibliometrics and scholarly publishing, and any other academic research. We want individuals with a solid interest in The Unjournal project and its goals, and the ability to meet the minimal time commitment. Applying is extremely quick, and those not chosen will be considered for other roles and work going forward.

### **Advisory Board Members**

Beyond the direct roles within the Unjournal, we're also in the process of establishing a larger, more passive advisory board to be part of our network, to offer occasional feedback and guidance, and to act as an evaluation manager (see our [evaluation workflow](../../our-policies-evaluation-and-workflow/mapping-evaluation-workflow.md)) when needed.&#x20;

**Time commitment**: There is no time obligation for this role, only potential and occasional consultation.&#x20;

**Compensation:** Case-by-case basis.

**Who we are looking for**: Active researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders with a strong publication record, and who are affiliated with an academic, governmental, or relevant non-profit institution.

### **Evaluators**

We will reach out to evaluators (aka 'reviewers') on a case-by-case basis, appropriate for each paper or project being assessed. This is dependent on expertise, the researchers' interest, and a lack of conflict of interest.&#x20;

**Time commitment**: Case-by-case basis.

**Compensation**: We pay a minimum of $250 per evaluation (typically $350), with some additional funding for ‘most-helpful-evaluator’ prizes. (_June 2023: We plan to significantly increase this compensation and add substantial incentives.)_

**Who we are looking for:** We are putting together a list of people interested in being an evaluator and doing paid referee work for the Unjournal. These will often be the first people we look to when considering potential evaluators.&#x20;

## **Projects and papers**

We are very interested in finding relevant research work to evaluate and assess during our pilot phase. We are offering small bounties for submissions. You may also want to put forward your own work [here](https://unjournaldev.cloud68.co/login).

We provide a separate form for research suggestions [here](https://airtable.com/shrdHHI0zK7rkJCP3). We may follow up with you individually.

## Contact us

If you are interested in discussing any of the above in person, please email us ([theunjournal@gmail.com](mailto:theunjournal@gmail.com)) to arrange a conversation.

\
We invite you to fill in this [form](https://airtable.com/shrW9xpIrxNGfxkXW) to leave your contact information, as well as outlining which parts of the project you may be interested in.
