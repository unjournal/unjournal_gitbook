# Recap: submissions

## Details of submissions to The Unjournal

Note: this section largely repeats content in our [guide for Researchers/Authors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DAgVYq0LW5\_sx30XP7PeM3isBzsxvivqzxDFsZao7TA/edit?usp=sharing), esp. our [FAQ ‘why engage’](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/faq-interaction/for-researchers-authors#why-should-researchers-and-groups-submit-their-work-to-and-engage-with-the-unjournal). For more information about The Unjournal, [here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/) is the link to our Gitbook.&#x20;

### What we are looking for&#x20;

We describe the nature of the work we are looking to evaluate in our Gitbook, and we give some examples in the [forum post HERE](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see#Some\_suggested\_\_sort\_of\_things\_we\_might\_be\_looking\_for\_). We currently have an ongoing pilot of four papers; however, we are looking for more research to evaluate. If you are interested in submitting your work for public evaluation, we are looking for research which is relevant to **global priorities, especially quantitative social sciences, and impact evaluations. Work that would benefit from further feedback and evaluation is also of interest.**

Your work will be evaluated using our evaluation guidelines and metrics. If you would like to read these evaluation guidelines and metrics before submitting, please click [here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/policies-evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators).

**Important Note**: We are not a journal. By having your work evaluated, you will not be giving up the opportunity to have your work published in a journal. We simply operate a system to have your work independently evaluated.

[If you think your work fits these criteria and you would like it to be publicly evaluated, please submit your work through this form on our platform. ](https://unjournaldev.cloud68.co/kotahi/versions/07ee3dd9-4f5b-42bf-bb4e-b9b818fe80f2/submit)

Please note that you will require an ORCID account in order to log in. If you don’t already have an account, it takes two minutes to [register an ORCID new account here](https://orcid.org/register).&#x20;

If you would like to submit more than one of your papers, you will need to complete a new form for each paper you submit.&#x20;

### Conditional embargo on the publishing of evaluations&#x20;

By default, we would like Unjournal evaluations to be made public. Please see [here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/faq-interaction/for-researchers-authors) as to why we think public evaluations are generally good for authors. However, in special circumstances, and particularly for very early-career researchers, we may make exceptions.&#x20;

If there is an early-career researcher on the author team, we will allow authors to ‘embargo’ publication of the evaluation until a later date. This date is contingent, but not indefinite. The embargo, (unless authors give earlier permission for release, or until a fixed upper limit of 14 months), will last until after a PhD/postdoc’s upcoming job-market or until after publication in a mainstream journal.

If you would like to request an exception to a public evaluation, you will have the opportunity to explain your reasoning in the submission form.&#x20;

### Why might an author want to engage with The Unjournal?&#x20;

1. **Substantive feedback** will help you improve your work, especially useful for young scholars.&#x20;
2. **Ratings = Markers of credibility for your work** that could help your career advancement at least at the margin, and hopefully in the future help a great deal. The opportunity to **publicly respond to critiques and correct misunderstandings.**&#x20;
3. An **additional opportunity for evaluation** of your work with an emphasis on **impact**.&#x20;
4. **Visibility** and a connection to the EA/Global Priorities communities and the Open Science movement.&#x20;
5. **Gain a reputation** as an ‘**early adopter and innovator**’ in open science.&#x20;
6. **Prizes**: You may win a “best project prize,” which could be financial as well as reputational.&#x20;
7. Entering ‘into our system’ will make you **more likely to be hired** as a paid reviewer or editorial manager.&#x20;
8. We will encourage **media coverage**.&#x20;

### What we might ask of authors&#x20;

If we consider your work for public evaluation, we may ask for **some** of the below, but these are mainly optional. We will aim to make this very **light touch** for authors.&#x20;

1. **A link to a non-paywalled, hosted version of your work** (which could be in any format - PDFs are not necessary), which could be given a DOI, or Digital Object Identifier. Again, we will not be "publishing" this work, just evaluating it.&#x20;
2. **A link to data and code**, if possible. We will work to help you to make it accessible.&#x20;
3. **Assignment of two evaluators who will be paid to assess your work**. We will likely keep their identities confidential, although this is flexible depending on the reviewer. We will facilitate a confidential channel to enable a dialogue with the authors, where this seems particular helpful. We will also have one person on our managing team handle this process.&#x20;
4. **Have evaluators publicly post their reviews of your work on our platform**. As noted above, we will ask them to provide feedback, thoughts, suggestions, and some quantitative ratings for the paper.&#x20;

* By completing the submission form, you are providing your permission to post the reviews publicly, unless you request an embargo.&#x20;
* You will have a two-week window to be able to respond through our platform before anything is posted publicly. Your responses can also be posted publicly.&#x20;

For more information on why authors may want to engage and what we may ask authors to do, please see our [Gitbook](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/faq-interaction/for-researchers-authors) page “For Researchers/Authors”.&#x20;
