The "Unjournal" (with funding from the [Long Term Future Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future)) organizes and funds public journal-independent feedback and evaluation. We will focus on research that is highly relevant to global priorities (especially in economics, social science, and impact evaluation; we aim to expand this widely). We will encourage better research by making it easier for researchers to get feedback and credible ratings on their work.

We are offering this prize to help identify work for The Unjournal: we aim to publicly evaluate 15 papers (or projects) within our pilot year.

This award will honor researchers doing robust, credible, transparent work with a global impact.

Research will be chosen by our management team for public evaluation (by 2-3 selected paid reviewers), based on an initial assessment of their methodological strength, openness, clarity, relevance to [global priorities](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/the-field-and-ea-gp-research/what-is-ea-gp-relevant-research), and the usefulness of further evaluation and public discussion. We sketch [these criteria here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/policies-and-templates/considering-projects).

All evaluations (including quantitative ratings) will be made public by default; however, we will consider ‘embargos’ on this for researchers with sensitive career concerns (the linked form asks about this). **Note that submitting your work to the Unjournal does not imply ‘publishing it’: you can submit it to any journal before, during, or after this.**

_(Note: If we choose not to send your work out to reviewers, we will try to at least offer some brief private feedback.)_

Our management team and advisory board will vote on the prize winners in light of the evaluations, with possible consultation of further external expertise.

All work evaluated by The Unjournal will be eligible for the prize. Engagement with The Unjournal, including responding to evaluator comments, will be a factor in determining the prize winners. We also have a slight preference for giving at least one of the awards to an early-career researcher, but this need not be determinative.

We especially encourage submission of research in ‘open’ formats such as hosted dynamic documents (Quarto, R-markdown, Jupyter notebooks, etc).

**Deadline: 20 November (to ensure eligibility)**

## Details of submissions to The Unjournal

Note: this section largely repeats content in our [guide for Researchers/Authors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DAgVYq0LW5\_sx30XP7PeM3isBzsxvivqzxDFsZao7TA/edit?usp=sharing), esp. our [FAQ ‘why engage’ ](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/faq-interaction/for-researchers-authors#why-should-researchers-and-groups-submit-their-work-to-and-engage-with-the-unjournal)

### What we are looking for&#x20;

We describe the nature of the work we are looking to evaluate in our Gitbook, and we give some examples in the [forum post HERE](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see#Some\_suggested\_\_sort\_of\_things\_we\_might\_be\_looking\_for\_). We currently have an ongoing pilot of four papers; however, we are looking for more research to evaluate. If you are interested in submitting your work for public evaluation, we are looking for research which is relevant to **global priorities, especially quantitative social sciences, and impact evaluations. Work that would benefit from further feedback and evaluation is also of interest.**

Your work will be evaluated using our evaluation guidelines and metrics. If you would like to read these evaluation guidelines and metrics before submitting, please click [here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/policies-evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators).

**Important Note**: We are not a journal. By having your work evaluated, you will not be giving up the opportunity to have your work published in a journal. We simply operate a system to have your work independently evaluated.

[If you think your work fits these criteria and you would like it to be publicly evaluated, please submit your work through this form on our platform. ](https://unjournaldev.cloud68.co/kotahi/versions/07ee3dd9-4f5b-42bf-bb4e-b9b818fe80f2/submit)

Please note that you will require an ORCID account in order to log in. If you don’t already have an account, it takes two minutes to [register an ORCID new account here](https://orcid.org/register).&#x20;

If you would like to submit more than one of your papers, you will need to complete a new form for each paper you submit.&#x20;

### Conditional embargo on the publishing of evaluations&#x20;

By default, we would like Unjournal evaluations to be made public. Please see [here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/faq-interaction/for-researchers-authors) as to why we think public evaluations are generally good for authors. However, in special circumstances, and particularly for very early-career researchers, we may make exceptions.&#x20;

If there is an early-career researcher on the author team, we will allow authors to ‘embargo’ publication of the evaluation until a later date. This date is contingent, but not indefinite. The embargo, (unless authors give earlier permission for release, or until a fixed upper limit of 14 months), will last until after a PhD/postdoc’s upcoming job-market or until after publication in a mainstream journal.

If you would like to request an exception to a public evaluation, you will have the opportunity to explain your reasoning in the submission form.&#x20;

### Why might an author want to engage with The Unjournal?&#x20;

1. **Substantive feedback** will help you improve your work, especially useful for young scholars.&#x20;
2. **Ratings = Markers of credibility for your work** that could help your career advancement at least at the margin, and hopefully in the future help a great deal. The opportunity to **publicly respond to critiques and correct misunderstandings.**&#x20;
3. An **additional opportunity for evaluation** of your work with an emphasis on **impact**.&#x20;
4. **Visibility** and a connection to the EA/Global Priorities communities and the Open Science movement.&#x20;
5. **Gain a reputation** as an ‘**early adopter and innovator**’ in open science.&#x20;
6. **Prizes**: You may win a “best project prize,” which could be financial as well as reputational.&#x20;
7. Entering ‘into our system’ will make you **more likely to be hired** as a paid reviewer or editorial manager.&#x20;
8. We will encourage **media coverage**.&#x20;

### What we might ask of authors&#x20;

If we consider your work for public evaluation, we may ask for **some** of the below, but these are mainly optional. We will aim to make this very **light touch** for authors.&#x20;

1. **A link to a non-paywalled, hosted version of your work** (which could be in any format - PDFs are not necessary), which could be given a DOI, or Digital Object Identifier. Again, we will not be "publishing" this work, just evaluating it.&#x20;
2. **A link to data and code**, if possible. We will work to help you to make it accessible.&#x20;
3. **Assignment of two evaluators who will be paid to assess your work**. We will likely keep their identities confidential, although this is flexible depending on the reviewer. We will facilitate a confidential channel to enable a dialogue with the authors, where this seems particular helpful. We will also have one person on our managing team handle this process.&#x20;
4. **Have evaluators publicly post their reviews of your work on our platform**. As noted above, we will ask them to provide feedback, thoughts, suggestions, and some quantitative ratings for the paper.&#x20;

* By completing the submission form, you are providing your permission to post the reviews publicly, unless you request an embargo.&#x20;
* You will have a two-week window to be able to respond through our platform before anything is posted publicly. Your responses can also be posted publicly.&#x20;

For more information on why authors may want to engage and what we may ask authors to do, please see our [Gitbook](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/faq-interaction/for-researchers-authors) page “For Researchers/Authors”.&#x20;
