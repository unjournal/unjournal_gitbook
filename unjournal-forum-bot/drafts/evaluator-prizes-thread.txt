🏆 The Unjournal's 2024-25 Evaluator Prizes

We're recognizing 8 expert peer reviewers for outstanding evaluation work — assessing others' research with rigor and transparency. $6,500 in prizes.

These are evaluators, not the original authors. 🧵

🥇 FIRST PRIZE ($2,000): @EdoardoMasset & Hugh Waddington

Evaluated: "Water Treatment & Child Mortality: A Meta-analysis"

They identified missing studies, caught protocol deviations, and flagged methodological fragility in the headline results. @GiveWell called their review "very influential."

🥈 SECOND PRIZE: @david_reiley ($1,000)

Evaluated: "Does Online Fundraising Increase Charitable Giving?"

Applied technical credibility checks + deep sector knowledge of digital advertising economics. Provided actionable critique that strengthens the evidence base.

🥈 SECOND PRIZE: Eleanor Tsai ($1,000)

Evaluated: "Maternal Cash Transfers for Gender Equity & Child Development"

Carefully assessed measurement validity, interpretation issues, and real-world contextual factors in this RCT on conditional transfers.

🥈 SECOND PRIZE: Cannon Cloud ($1,000)

Evaluated: "Global Potential for Natural Regeneration in Deforested Tropical Regions"

Caught critical technical issues: temporal data leakage and model overfitting that could undermine the study's reforestation potential estimates.

🎖️ HONORABLE MENTIONS:

• Matthew Jané — animal welfare intervention meta-analysis
• Gregory Lewis — tech risks & returns to science
• 3 anonymous reviewers — UBI (Kenya), climate/GDP, mental health

Each provided constructive expert critique.

Why open evaluation matters:

When expert reviewers publicly assess research, they catch issues that improve evidence quality. Sometimes this informs major funders' decisions.

We pay evaluators ~$450/review because peer review deserves recognition.
