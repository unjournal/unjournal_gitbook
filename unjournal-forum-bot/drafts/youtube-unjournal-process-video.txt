TITLE:
The Unjournal Process: How We Evaluate Research (Part 1)

DESCRIPTION:
How does The Unjournal evaluate research? This video walks through our six-step process for rigorous, transparent peer review. This video was read and produced by an Unjournal field specialist.

THE PROCESS:
1. Research curation/identification/submission, prioritization by field specialists on our team
2. Evaluation manager recruits expert evaluators (reviewers)
3. Detailed evaluation reports with quantitative ratings
4. Author response, evaluators can adjust
5. Manager synthesis and summary
6. Public dissemination (pubpub, academic databases) with DOIs

KEY FEATURES:
• Evaluators are compensated (~avg. $350-$450 per review)
• 3-5 week evaluation timelines
• Benchmarked ratings; overall across criteria
• Anonymous or signed evaluations
• All materials publicly accessible with DOIs

The Unjournal provides open, rigorous evaluation of quantitative research — especially economics, policy, and social science relevant to global priorities.
