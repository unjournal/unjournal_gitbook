🥇 FIRST PRIZE: Edoardo Masset & Hugh Waddington
Evaluated "Water Treatment & Child Mortality" meta-analysis.

A "rare example of evaluators bringing systematic review and policy expertise directly to bear on a prominent and policy-relevant meta-analysis."

They identified missing studies & protocol deviations. Noted that "odds ratio estimates differed between working paper drafts" and that "conclusions may need to be qualified."

GiveWell found their review "very influential" — it "flagged issues that should be addressed." This evaluation informed real grantmaking decisions on chlorination interventions.

🥈 SECOND PRIZE: David Reiley
Evaluated "Does Online Fundraising Increase Charitable Giving? A Nationwide Field Experiment on Facebook"

Reiley brought decades of experience in charitable giving economics and digital advertising practice to this evaluation.

He delivered "one of the portfolio's most detailed reports" — combining technical credibility checks with practical sector insights and decision-facing guidance.

He assessed researcher degrees of freedom, data robustness, and assumptions — while interpreting what results mean for fundraisers' measurement choices and advertising budgets.

The goal: help high-impact charities optimize advertising by clarifying direct returns and potential crowding-out effects on related causes.

🥈 SECOND PRIZE: Eleanor Tsai
Evaluated "Maternal Cash Transfers for Gender Equity and Child Development: Experimental Evidence from India"

Tsai "takes a large, rigorous RCT seriously" — focusing on what decision-makers care about: measurement validity, interpretation accuracy, and real-world applicability.

Her approach treated the research seriously while stress-testing comparisons and questioning practical implementation in development policy contexts.

🥈 SECOND PRIZE: Cannon Cloud
Evaluated "Global Potential for Natural Regeneration in Deforested Tropical Regions"

Cloud showed "tremendous effort, follow-through, and specific technical insight" — going "well beyond surface-level review."

He raised substantive methodological concerns: temporal data leakage (predictors derived from outcomes, leading to "overly optimistic estimates"), outdated forest data, and potential confounding.

Cloud engaged in collaborative dialogue with the co-evaluator and maintains ongoing conversations with authors — exemplifying productive scholarly engagement through open evaluation.

🎖️ HONORABLE MENTION: Greg Lewis
Evaluated "The Returns to Science in the Presence of Technological Risks"

Lewis made "the clearest case" that the paper's framing unfairly compared all benefits of science against only biotechnology risks — while omitting other technological dangers like AI.

He proposed a constructive solution: narrow to bioscience benefits for a fairer "like for like" comparison. The author praised this as "quite a good critique" and added new calculations in response.

🎖️ HONORABLE MENTION: Matthew Jané
Evaluated a meta-analysis on meat consumption interventions.

Jané "acknowledged the authors' efforts while providing substantive, clearly articulated criticisms alongside specific recommendations" — aiming to strengthen the methodology.

🎖️ Three anonymous reviewers provided strong evaluations: one emphasized external validity concerns in Kenya's UBI experiment; another brought clinical expertise to mental health cost-effectiveness analysis.

Why reward peer review? Evaluation is essential infrastructure for good research — yet it's often invisible and unpaid. We want to change that.

Public expert review improves evidence quality and can inform major funders' decisions. Open dialogue between evaluators and authors exemplifies how scholarship should work.

The Unjournal pays evaluators ~$450/review. We believe rigorous peer review deserves real recognition and compensation.
