🥇 FIRST PRIZE: Edoardo Masset & Hugh Waddington

Evaluated "Water Treatment & Child Mortality: A Meta-analysis"

A "rare example of evaluators bringing systematic review and policy expertise directly to bear on a prominent and policy-relevant meta-analysis."

They identified missing studies and protocol deviations. Noted signs of fragility... "odds ratio estimates differed between working paper drafts." GiveWell found their review "very influential" — it informed real grantmaking decisions on chlorination interventions.

🥈 SECOND PRIZE: David Reiley

Evaluated "Does Online Fundraising Increase Charitable Giving? A Nationwide Field Experiment on Facebook"

Reiley brought decades of experience in charitable giving economics and digital advertising. He delivered "one of the portfolio's most detailed reports" — combining technical credibility checks with practical sector insights and decision-facing guidance.

—

🥈 SECOND PRIZE: Eleanor Tsai

Evaluated "Maternal Cash Transfers for Gender Equity and Child Development: Experimental Evidence from India"

Tsai "takes a large, rigorous RCT seriously" — focusing on what decision-makers care about: measurement validity, interpretation accuracy, and real-world applicability.

🥈 SECOND PRIZE: Cannon Cloud

Evaluated "Global Potential for Natural Regeneration in Deforested Tropical Regions"

Cloud showed "tremendous effort, follow-through, and specific technical insight" — going "well beyond surface-level review." He raised substantive methodological concerns and engaged in collaborative dialogue with authors, exemplifying productive scholarly engagement.

🎖️ HONORABLE MENTIONS:

• Greg Lewis evaluated "The Returns to Science in the Presence of Technological Risks" — making "the clearest case" that the paper's framing unfairly compared all benefits of science against only biotech risks. The author praised this as "quite a good critique."

• Matthew Jané provided rigorous critique of a meta-analysis on meat consumption interventions.

• Three anonymous reviewers contributed strong evaluations on UBI, climate economics, and mental health interventions.

Why reward peer review?

Evaluation is essential infrastructure for good research — yet it's often invisible and unpaid. We want to change that.

Public expert review improves evidence quality and can inform major funders' decisions.

We pay evaluators ~$450/review because peer review deserves recognition.
