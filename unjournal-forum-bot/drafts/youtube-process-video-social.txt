This was produced and narrated by one of our field specialists. We're hoping to create more explainer videos like this — covering specific topics, FAQs, and how our evaluations inform real-world decisions.

Suggestions welcome! What would you like us to explain? What questions do you have about open peer review, our process, or how evaluations get used? Reply or DM us.

New video: The Unjournal Process — Explained in 2 Minutes

We've released a short video walking through how The Unjournal evaluates research, from start to finish:

1. Research curation/identification/submission, prioritization by field specialists
2. Evaluation manager recruits expert evaluators
3. Detailed evaluation reports with quantitative ratings
4. Author response (evaluators can adjust)
5. Manager synthesis and summary
6. Public dissemination with DOIs

This video was produced and narrated by one of our field specialists. We're hoping to create more content like this — explainers on specific topics, FAQs, and how our evaluations inform funders and policymakers.
